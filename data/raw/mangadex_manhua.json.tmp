        "description": "10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as “Hunters”. However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I’m someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the “World’s Weakest”. Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!\n\n---\n**Links:**\n\n- Official English Translation [<Pocket Comics>](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/320) | [<WebNovel>](https://www.webnovel.com/comic/only-i-level-up-(solo-leveling)_15227640605485101) | [<Tapas>](https://tapas.io/series/solo-leveling-comic/info)\n- Alternate Official Raw - [Kakao Webtoon](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/나-혼자만-레벨업/2320)",

After a failed attempt to extract the black magic within Leslie by sacrificing her to transfer it to Eli, Leslie knocks on the door of the monster Duchess Salvatore and, battered, bruised and desperate, pleads for the Duchess to adopt her?!\n\n---\n\nThe Speràdo family line possesses a secret: shadow magic. But it's been 100 years since someone last wielded it. When Marquis Speràdo tries to sacrifice Leslie for her favored sister Ellie, little does he know that this awakens the power of darkness in her instead. To escape her family's greed and abuse, Leslie's out to make a deal with the Monstrous Duke: adopt her, and her powers will be at the duke's disposal. Will Leslie escape her parents' cruel grip, or succumb to their evil exploits?\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Chapter 130 is marked by the author as the end of the main story, and Chapters 131 to 150 is listed as an epilogue and flashback-origin story for Duchess Salvatore and her family.\n\n---\n\n- [Alternative Raw (Kakao Webtoon)](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EA%B4%B4%EB%AC%BC-%EA%B3%B5%EC%9E%91%EA%B0%80%EC%9D%98-%EA%B3%84%EC%95%BD-%EA%B3%B5%EB%85%80/2336)",

Her peaceful, everyday life as a noble lady, a stark contrast to her past life, is short-lived, however.\n\nWith the bankruptcy of her father's failed trade business, her family falls into great debt. Astina decides to sell herself off to marry Grand Duke Thereode in place of her sister Kanna to save her family from their financial crisis. But Thereode is forever cursed to take on the form of a beast, and no one expects her to survive the night with him…\n\nStill, defying all odds, she fights the beast with her impressive swordsmanship, and miraculously survives. Over time, a slow relationship begins to kindle between them as she tames him as her pet.\n\n---\nFollowing a life of bloodshed and heartbreak, the great Empress Martina is reborn as Astina, the genius daughter of a humble count. But her peaceful world is shattered when bankruptcy forces her father to marry her off to the dangerous Archduke Atalenta. All of high society knows him as \"Theriod the Beast\" because of a family curse that turned him into a wild monster. Luckily, even the deadly beast of Atalenta is no match for the former empress's mighty sword. \n\nEveryone is shocked when the new archduchess tames her husband all too easily and takes over as the family head. No one's more surprised than Astina, however, when her casual kiss returns Theriod to his human form. Not only does he resemble her past life lover, but he has no memory of her from his wolf days. Despite these awkward circumstances, can the new power couple join hands to rule over the archduchy?\n\n---\n[Official English Novel Translation](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/the-lady-and-the-beast-novel)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EA%B7%B8%EB%85%80%EC%99%80-%EC%95%BC%EC%88%98/2760), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=55566760)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/the-lady-and-the-beast)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/the-lady-and-the-beast-fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.tappytoon.com/de/comics/the-lady-and-the-beast-de)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/The-Lady-and-the-Beast/24)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/67330)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%97%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%A3/210)",

Who knew that her story would catch my attention because I was her in my past life? Destined for terrible ends, I’ve died twice—but I refuse to die a third time as a pawn in someone else’s scheme. I’m no longer the vain and naïve princess. Now that I know how the story will unfold, I’ll turn the tables around and have everyone dancing to my tune. This time, I’ll be the one pulling the strings.\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EB%85%80%EB%8A%94-%EB%A7%88%EB%A6%AC%EC%98%A4%EB%84%A4%ED%8A%B8/2464), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/56422254)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* English: [Radish](https://radishfiction.com/stories/17106), [Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/the-villainess-is-a-marionette/info) [Yenpress (vol)](https://yenpress.com/series/the-villainess-is-a-marionette)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%83%A1%E5%A5%B3%E6%98%AF%E6%87%B8%E7%B5%B2%E6%9C%A8%E5%81%B6/94)\n* [French / Français](https://fr.piccoma.com/fr/product/231)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/The-Villainess-is-a-Marionette/40)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/67171)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%94/117)",

I managed to avoid my death with some previous knowledge about my life, as this was my second time at it. Now, I should be able to live a peaceful life!\n\n“I’m not going to marry a man unless he has everything. I want the most wealthy, famous, and competent man there is.”\n\nI dreamt of a glamorous life as the daughter of the duke, but my father tells me the Crown Prince who is known to be a lunatic is to be my husband! As an extraordinary measure, I couldn’t help but start a contract relationship. That is, with a handsome side character that looks better than the main one.\n\n“Why are you trying to avoid being engaged to the prince?”\n\n“He’s scary. I heard that he even kills his own entourage if he doesn’t like them.”\n\nA few days later, the prince sent a terrible letter to me.\n\n“I will not kill you.”\n\nOh no, did I set up another death trap for myself?\n\n---\nJuvelian is a villainess so hated by everyone that even her lover and father leave her to die a pitiful death. Just as she's about to face her fate, she gets the chance to change the course of her story. In order to avoid the tragic end she knows awaits her, she breaks up with her lover and gives up trying to win her father's love. Instead, she focuses on using his wealth to enjoy her new life to its fullest! But while she prepares for her extravagant life as a lady, her father begins looking for her new suitor. Afraid that he'll marry her off to the infamously unpredictable and stormy prince, she lands on a desperate solution: a dating contract. And the best candidate is none other than her father's student.\n\n---\n[Original Novel](https://page.kakao.com/content/52616424)\n[Official English Translation of the Novel](https://wordexcerpt.com/series/daddy-i-dont-want-to-marry/)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%84%EB%B9%A0-%EB%82%98-%EC%9D%B4-%EA%B2%B0%ED%98%BC-%EC%95%88-%ED%95%A0%EB%9E%98%EC%9A%94/2472), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/56556599)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/father-i-dont-want-this-marriage)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/9772/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E7%88%B8%E7%88%B8%E6%88%91%E4%B8%8D%E6%83%B3%E7%B5%90%E5%A9%9A/101)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/father-i-dont-want-this-marriage-fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.tappytoon.com/de/comics/father-i-dont-want-this-marriage-de)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Ayah-Aku-Tidak-Mau-Menikah/37)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/66124)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%97%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%9E%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD_%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99/125)",

He’s so young that he looks like he’s still sucking on his tiny fingers! How could I ever hurt him?”\n\nThis child is so cute that I can’t believe that he would become a villain. And so, I’ve decided. I will protect him! This way, he will protect me too!\n\n---\nSummoned into her favorite novel as the infamous Duchess Roselia Chade, Haena is bathed in riches, power, and a family of her own. Life couldn’t be better, save for the small detail that her beloved stepson, Einspanner Chade, is also the evil mastermind destined to kill her. At this point in the story Ein is still just an adorable child yet to reach his cruel awakening, and so Roselia is determined to stop him from becoming a ruthless killer. But with the duke getting in her way and trying to poison his own son, safely raising a child that was primed for villainy may prove harder than she originally thought.

It is time for Charlize to tame the one who will bring forth her revenge.\n\n---\n**Original Novel:** [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/52478267), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=6005645)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%ED%8F%AD%EA%B5%B0%EC%9D%84-%EA%B8%B8%EB%93%A4%EC%9D%B4%EA%B3%A0-%EB%8F%84%EB%A7%9D%EC%B3%90%EB%B2%84%EB%A0%B8%EB%8B%A4/2457), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/56310553)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* English: [Radish](https://radishfiction.com/stories/18026), [Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/the-taming-of-the-tyrant/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%88%91%E5%9C%A8%E9%A6%B4%E6%9C%8D%E6%9A%B4%E5%90%9B%E5%BE%8C%E8%90%BD%E8%B7%91%E4%BA%86/155)\n* [French / Français](https://www.delitoon.com/webtoon/fuir_le_tyran_que_jai_cree)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.delitoon.de/detail/dad_0010059)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/I-Tamed-a-Tyrant-and-Ran-Away/179)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/72074)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81/173)",

And with neglected hair hanging over half of her face, this small child is actually the forgotten Royal Princess of the Empire. Unable to stifle her hunger any longer, she crawls out of her hiding within a tiny, old, worn-down castle in search of food…\n\n\"I'm hungry,\" the small girl who's wearing nothing but shabby clothes murmured without even realizing, \"Can I eat this…?\"\n\nHer small fern-like hand tore a piece of vegetation off of the ground, but she eventually put it down while shaking her head from side to side. The little girl hadn't had a proper meal for three days…\n\n\"Estrella…\" the child recited the name, her words one with the wind. It was a precious name that she had earned only after a long time.\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm late.\"\n\n\"…It's alright,\" the little one who replied then slumped onto Elias' chest.\n\n---\nA girl with glowing, bejeweled eyes and a tiny dragon has been found in an abandoned palace...and there is no doubt she is the long-forgotten daughter of the Emperor. Growing up wild and free, she is unaware of how special she is, especially since her eyes see things others cannot. As the Emperor and his three other children take her in and try to get closer to her, will she learn to trust them? And will this new addition to their family bring fortune or ruin to the empire?\n\n---\n**Original Novel:**\n* Chapters: [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/54097129), [OneStory](https://onestory.co.kr/detail/H041045698)\n* Volumes: [MrBlue](https://mrblue.com/novel/detail/E000081680?pid=E000081680), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=6287397), [RidiBooks](https://ridibooks.com/books/2259005289)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%93%B0%EB%A0%88%EA%B8%B0%EC%9E%A5-%EC%86%8D-%ED%99%A9%EB%85%80%EB%8B%98/2397), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=55166366)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/princess-in-the-rough/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc30062)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E5%BB%A2%E5%A2%9F%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E7%9A%87%E5%A5%B3/139)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Putri-yang-Telantar/168)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/61877)\n* [Russian / Ру́сский](https://moykomiks.com/series/507646/)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%8D%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B0/120)",

Even though she received all kinds of persecution by the three Ernst sons in 20 years of life at the Ernst estate, she could finally escape that blood-and-tear inducing life when she was about to get married.\n\n*But what is this? When I woke up from my sleep, I'm back to that hellish childhood! Is this a dream?! Hmph. If I can't wake up from this dream,  I'll at least live without too much consideration for others now!*\n\nJust like that, Harley decided to go astray. Eugene, the \"dutiful son\" but cold, Cabel, the roughhousing knucklehead, and Erich, the angelic-looking bully and Arina's twin, *all three be damned!*\n\n----\nHarley thought that marriage would be her ticket out of the Ernst household and away from the family's three sons, aka her perpetual tormenters. But on the eve of her wedding, she's transported back in time 20 years to a youth she'd hoped to forget. As long as she's getting a second chance at childhood, Harley's determined to stand up to her bullies. But what began as retaliation quickly turns into reconciliation as both Harley and the Ernst brothers come to understand each other's pain.\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EA%B7%B8-%EC%98%A4%EB%B9%A0%EB%93%A4%EC%9D%84-%EC%A1%B0%EC%8B%AC%ED%95%B4/2367), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/54286072)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/harley-takes-the-house/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](http://kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/7024/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E5%BE%81%E6%9C%8D%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E8%A8%8E%E5%8E%AD%E9%AC%BC%E5%93%A5%E5%93%A5/216)\n* [French / Français](https://delitoon.com/webtoon/mes-freres-infernaux)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Beware-of-the-Brothers/158)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/55776)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B1%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5/246)",

        "description": "I seem to have reincarnated in the world of an R-rated romance fantasy novel. And not just as an ordinary character, but as the witch who loses her life to the crazy male lead! Luckily there is a long 200 years until the main characters are born and grow into their roles. Now since my life is not in imminent danger, shall I leisurely think of ways to avoid death?\n\nHowever, I had not taken notice of a very important detail about the time I'd be spending 'safe from imminent danger.' 200 years was by no means a short waiting period and by the time the younger version of the male lead appeared in front of me, I had completely forgotten the original novel's plot!\n\nOh, whatever, now that it's come to this, the only way to survive is to raise the male lead into a sane and stable adult! The first step to avoiding death by the hands of the tyrant male lead is changing this extremely frightened child's life.\n\n\"It must be very inconvenient for you to have me suddenly show up on your doorstep, I'm sorry. You can tell me to go away, I'll be fine.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Do I look like someone who could be inconvenienced by a little boy like you? Also, what do you mean by you'll be fine even if told to go away? It's not like you have anywhere to go back to, kid.\"\n  \nThe little boy burst into tears.  \n  \n'Oh, this is so not it,' was what the witch thought to herself as the little boy sobbed.\n\n---\nClete's heart sinks when a little child shows up on her doorstep one day. The wide-eyed boy is none other than Alpen, the emperor's illegitimate son and her terrifying future killer. But as a powerful witch herself, Clete is not one to surrender to fate. She decides to raise him with warmth and kindness in the hopes that he will walk a different path in life this time. The only problem? She has no idea how to raise a human child! With the help of her loyal butler, she starts with the basics: reading him a storybook, playing house, making him a friend... The two eventually form a special bond that she never thought was possible. But when dark forces begin to interfere, it becomes harder and harder to keep the boy from succumbing to evil. Will Clete's powers be enough to alter the future? Or will she inevitably meet her tragic end?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%ED%8F%AD%EA%B5%B0%EC%9D%98-%EB%B3%B4%ED%98%B8%EC%9E%90%EB%8A%94-%EC%95%85%EC%97%AD-%EB%A7%88%EB%85%80%EC%9E%85%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/2447), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=56113952)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/comics/tyrants-guardian-is-evil-witch/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc29534)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/tyrants-guardian-is-evil-witch-fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.tappytoon.com/de/comics/tyrants-guardian-is-evil-witch-de)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Wali-Sang-Tiran-adalah-Penyihir-Jahat/213)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/61053)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A/171)",

You’re the one who kept me by your side,” Amon whispered, as his feverish breath made her skin crawl, “So you have to take responsibility for me till the end, Bridey.”\n\nOnce the lovely cat was all grown up, she realized… She thought she raised him well, but she's going to be eaten up as well.\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list.nhn?titleId=761104)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/my-gently-raised-beast/list?title_no=2606)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.dongmanmanhua.cn/LOVE/wodeyemanmengyou/list?title_no=1576)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://www.webtoons.com/zh-hant/fantasy/mycutefriend/list?title_no=2441)\n* [French / Français](https://www.webtoons.com/fr/romance/j-ai-eleve-une-bete/list?title_no=2514)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.webtoons.com/de/romance/my-gently-raised-beast/list?title_no=2949)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://www.webtoons.com/id/romantic-fantasy/i-raised-a-beast/list?title_no=2422)\n* [Spanish / Español](https://www.webtoons.com/es/romance/my-gently-raised-beast/list?title_no=3105)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://www.webtoons.com/th/romantic-fantasy/i-raised-a-beast/list?title_no=2452)\n\n**Links:**\n* [Promotional Video](https://youtu.be/DqozLjc2Cn4)\n* [Original Web Novel](https://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list.nhn?titleId=761104)",

I couldn't do it while sober so I took a shot of liquid courage.\n\n\"I like you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I just like everything about you.\"\n\n\"…I don't understand.\"\n\nSomething's strange. His voice is deeper, his height slightly different, and his physique even more so. In fact, after a closer look, even the hair colour that reflected the moonlight⁠—this is crazy. It’s someone else. It's none other than Duke Cabel Willard who's known as the 'Grim Reaper' of the battlefields.\n\n\"Cabel.\"\n\n\"… Excuse me?\"\n\n\"From now on, don't refer to me by any strange titles. Call me by name instead.\"\n\nThe corners of his lips that were always frozen stiff curved into a smile. It seemed like he would immediately kill me if the truth of my false confession was brought to light.\n\n---\n\"I think I’ve fallen for you.\" With a single drunken confession, Renesha's plans to live a comfortable and uneventful life were shattered. Somehow she confessed her love to the wrong man: the Grim Reaper of the Battlefield, Duke Cavert Willard! It's the worst thing to happen to her since she woke up in this fantasy universe and discovered her divine powers. In the midst of a war with a neighboring country, Renesha must balance her duties as a healer with her feelings for two alluring knights. When romance blooms on the battlefield, who will be victorious in the battle for Renesha's heart?\n\n---\n**Original Novel:** [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/51171293), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=4161333)\n\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=53896020)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/comics/false-confession)\n* Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语: [AC.QQ](https://ac.qq.com/Comic/comicInfo/id/646253) (expired), [Kuaikan](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/5965/) (expired), [PODO](https://pdt.tencentac.com/?contentId=333)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E9%8C%AF%E8%AA%A4%E7%9A%84%E5%91%8A%E7%99%BD/103)\n* [French / Français](https://delitoon.com/webtoon/holy-me)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.delitoon.de/detail/dad_0010084)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://kakaopage.co.id/content/Wrong-Confession/3262)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/31453)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B0_%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%97%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99/69)",

Because of this, I had trouble adjusting to school as well.  \n  \nMy only hobby was reading a fantasy web novel <The Fake Lovers of the Academy> and imagining that I could become the main character of it. One day, after falling asleep and imagining this as usual… I woke up but instead of becoming the heroine, I'd become the villainess, Louise Sweeney, who meets a terrible ending.  \n  \n\"Since I know the original novel, if I just avoid falling in love at first sight with the male lead, I definitely won't have a tragic ending!\" Thinking this, Louise avoids the male lead.  \n  \nBut what's this…? Unlike the original novel, the male lead passionately confesses his love to Louise, and the heroine, who she believed to be kind, has it in for her…?!  \n  \nHow did this happen? Wasn't it supposed to all work out if I just avoided the male lead?!\n\n---\nWaking up inside your favorite novel sounds like a dream come true. Unless you’re born as the hated villainess, that is. Our new, full-fledged Louise Sweeny must try to reinvent her character to dodge her doomed fate of being killed off at the end of the story. It seemed easy enough at first, but there’s one big problem. The story, which she knew like the back of her hand, has veered so far off course that she can’t predict what plot twists are coming next. Can she avoid getting in the way of the male and female leads’ romance to save herself from impending demise?",

Left only with her wits and her strength, Pollyanna fights to rise up in the ranks. One day, she meets an ardent king, one who finally acknowledges her worth. Moved by his dream for unity, Pollyanna vows to fight for him. But now the young king is slowly realizing this stalwart knight has also conquered his heart.\n\n---\nAfter six years of pointless war between her country, the Kingdom of Ehas, and their neighbor enemies, the Kingdom of Cukda, aged 20, the woman soldier and former petty officer Pauliana Kellenbell has been defeated and captured in a storming attack by the army of another enemy nation, the Kingdom of Acrea, an attack she had personally predicted but fell on deaf ears by her superiors. She has been desperately trying to survive in men's society, but it was all in vain, her noble birthright having been taken away by her family by being sent to war, and having all her efforts crushed down by the fact that she's a woman in the all-male army of Ehas.\n\nAcrea's young king, Lucius, sees her struggle and potential, and makes an unexpected offer.

        "description": "The world falls into a state of panic when 120 million players of a popular VR game, Eternal World, vanish without a trace one day. A few months later, they begin returning one by one after dying in the game.\n\nBut they’re not the only ones to make it back - monsters also start to appear and wreak havoc on Earth. All hope seems lost until the Masked Monarch, the most powerful player of Eternal World, returns.\n\nHe quickly assembles his old team back together to defeat the beasts and the nefarious Demon King once and for all. But man-made weapons are useless against the enemies they must fight, and players are struggling to level up without the game’s special items or rewards.\n\nThe Masked Monarch has a few tricks up his sleeve, but will they be enough to save the world?\n\n\n- [Original Webtoon <Webtoon kakao>](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%82%98-%ED%98%BC%EC%9E%90-%EB%A7%8C%EB%A0%99-%EA%B7%80%ED%99%98%EC%9E%90/2431)",

He was a man who looked like the young lady that she used to serve.\n\n\"I'm here to keep my promise, Blair. You said that you'd be with me for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\"No way… Young Miss?\"\n\nAt that moment, the man's crimson eyes turned to meet mine. He bent down till our noses nearly touched and kissed my hair.\n\nAnd whispered — in a very sweet and beautiful voice —\n\n\"You have to call me Young Master now.\"\n\n…Huh?\n\n---\nWhen Su-A wakes up inside the world of her favorite novel as the character of Blair, she is determined to help the female protagonist, Chloe, get through the darkest period of her life. \n\nFor years, Chloe has had to endure discrimination and abuse for being an illegitimate child. Blair becomes her maid and confidante, and the two form a special friendship. But Chloe turns out to be quite a different character than the one described in the book. She wields black magic, sends Blair to fetch her mysterious potions, and seems totally uninterested in any of the male lead candidates. Then one day, a handsome man who looks an awful lot like Chloe shows up at Blair’s doorstep. Could it be…the lady she used to serve?! \n\nAll bets are off as plot twist after plot twist unravels in this unpredictable tale of love and redemption.\n\n---\n**Original Novel:** [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=52553678), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=5440800), [RidiBooks](https://ridibooks.com/books/2107059249)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%AA%A8%EC%8B%9C%EB%8D%98-%EC%95%84%EA%B0%80%EC%94%A8%EA%B0%80-%EB%8F%84%EB%A0%A8%EB%8B%98%EC%9D%B4-%EB%90%98%EC%96%B4%EB%B2%84%EB%A0%B8%EB%8B%A4/2400), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/55249956)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/lady-i-served-became-master)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/9783/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E5%B0%8F%E5%A7%90%E6%88%90%E7%82%BA%E5%B0%91%E7%88%BA%E7%9A%84%E7%A5%95%E5%AF%86/182)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/lady-i-served-became-master-fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.tappytoon.com/de/comics/lady-i-served-became-master-de)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Nona-yang-Kulayani-Jadi-Tuan-Muda/186)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/54266)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%8A%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%8B%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A7/163)",

She sacrificed herself as the eldest daughter of her family for them, lost her fiancée to her rival, and gave her life as a saintess for the kingdom… there was just calamities upon calamities happening.\n\n\"There's no point in dying. Fuck the sacrifice.\"\n\nDestroying her death flag and aiming a bow that will change her fate to fight God, the final boss!\n\n“So the actions I’m taking to save my life are evil?” she lifted the corner of her mouth and laughed, “If that’s the case, then I'd be happy to be a villainess.\"\n\n---\nA girl from the modern world slips into the body of Niveia Aerber, the main character of the fantasy novel she was reading. To survive in Erathil, a world full of betrayal and monsters where she was destined to meet an early death, the new Niveia embarks on an adventure to escape from her fate. The old Niveia was set to become the next Priestess to serve the Grand Temple, but not the new Niveia. Instead, she runs away from the temple, from her archrival, Rosanna, and her fiancé, Duke Aetius Timothero. Along the way, she enlists the help of Prince Caeles, who is also on a mission of his own - to find out which noble families are planning an uprising against his kingdom, including Niveia's family. In this chaotic turmoil of love, loyalty, and treason, can Niveia create a better future for herself, and more importantly, can she ever return to the real world?\n\n---\n**Official Translations:**\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/9828)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/284?languageCode=zh)\n* [French / Français](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/284?languageCode=fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/284?languageCode=de)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/To-Become-a-Villainess-is-not-for-Everyone/713)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://www.comico.jp/comic/284)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://www.comico.in.th/titles/2612)",

        "description": "Following the emperor's unjust massacre of her family and her own miserable death, Laliette Bellua wakes up to find that she is in the body of her 12-year-old self. She immediately sets her sights on a single goal: suck up to Emperor Rupert Edgar Laspe Vellelum and save her family. Laliette's plan is foolproof, except for one tiny detail... In her present timeline, the future emperor is still masquerading as a princess named Rapertte! With only a single suitcase and some change in her pocket, she sets out for the capital to become the princess' closest and most beloved attendant. Can Laliette prove her ability to keep a secret? And more importantly, will she be able to win the favor of the cruel and sadistic Rapertte?\n\n---\nIt was the end of a sunny summer day. In the hands of the tyrant, father, mother, brother and my neck went under the guillotine. And when I opened my eyes, it was my 12th birthday. Before the 13-year-old young Emperor became a brutal tyrant, I had to somehow become a god next to the man.\n\n\"I'm your maid of honor, so I'll follow you.\"\n\n\"I don't have much. And I don't own you.\"\n\nTo live and to save my family, I have to be in the eyes of that tyrant who didn't believe in humanity. Only then I can live. But that horrible monster is starting to change.\n\n\"I save what I lose in my hands. So don't hurt yourself without my permission.\"\n\n---\n**Original Novel:** [Bomtoon](https://www.bomtoon.com/comic/ep_list/eclair1), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/51679218), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=5737785)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%ED%8F%90%ED%95%98-%EB%98%90-%EC%A3%BD%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%84-%EB%A7%90%EC%95%84%EC%A3%BC%EC%84%B8%EC%9A%94/2428), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=55795261)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/your-majesty)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E9%99%9B%E4%B8%8B%E9%80%99%E6%AC%A1%E8%AB%8B%E9%A5%92%E6%88%91%E4%B8%80%E5%91%BD/157)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/your-majesty-fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.tappytoon.com/de/comics/your-majesty-de)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://kakaopage.co.id/content/Baginda-Tolong-Jangan-Bunuh-Saya-Lagi/3413)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/61342)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%9D%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%97_%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%86%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B0/178)",

So, when she has the opportunity to take her sister’s place in an arranged marriage to Emperor Kael Lu Kaldorf, Lilian jumps at the chance. \n\nThe only problem is, her prospective partner gets cranky without his sleep, and since being cursed by a vindictive witch, the tyrannical emperor hasn’t experienced a single moment of slumber. \n\nBut that’s no challenge for Lilian, who possesses the ability to induce sleep with a kiss. Now, tasked with the duty of keeping His Majesty well-rested, Lilian must kiss the emperor each night to keep his temper at bay. It’s a simple contractual agreement, and Lilian has no plans to develop romantic feelings, but what happens when Kael unexpectedly falls for her?\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home/55019214)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/ill-marry-him)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/ill-marry-him-fr)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://kakaopage.co.id/content/Biar-Aku-Saja-yang-Menikah/3437)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/63368)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://www.webtoons.com/th/romantic-fantasy/i-will-marry-him-then/list?title_no=2285)",

As if by chance, as if by fate, the two keep meeting and discover that their favorite artist is the indie musician “Long Afternoon.” They gradually grow closer and so the story began.\n\n---\nEvery night, Yeo-un takes the last train home—same route, same time, same routine.

But Hae-in isn’t just another fan—she’s the voice behind the band, a secret she can’t afford to reveal. As music draws them closer, the truth may threaten to pull them apart.

However, one day, I happened to possess Sylvia’s body, who drank poison and ended her own life. I didn’t want to live like her.\r\n\r\n“I’m rich and healthy, so why do I need to care about other people? This is my life, I’m going to live as I want!”\r\n\r\nI just wanted to live a quiet life, but…\r\n\r\n“Still, you’re my little sister, and you’re part of the Atlante family.”\r\n\r\nThe family’s a little strange.\r\n\r\n“I’m interested in you, not your younger sister.”\r\n\r\n“You must take responsibility for this body until the end. That’s the job of the contractor.”\r\n\r\n“I, Theve Hiddleton, swear to be the sword of Sylvia Atlante and devote everything to her.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t bother you. So please, keep me by your side!”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing in this world I can’t find. So don’t even try to run away from me.”\r\n\r\nThe handsome guys who I thought I’d never get involved with stuck around. What’s wrong with everyone? Isn’t this too different from Sylvia’s memory? I just wanted to live a peaceful life?!\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhat good is being reborn as the duke's daughter when you're the shame of the family? While her siblings were talented and beautiful, poor Sylvia was called fat and ugly, with a rumored bad personality to boot. Acting out for her cold father's attention only got her exiled from home and made her take her own life. But when the new \"Sylvia\" wakes up five years before her death, she could care less about the snarky opinions of others–she'll live this life her own way. In a world crawling with demons and thieves, she must use all the resources at her fingertips and prepare to survive on her own. Once she does, it's goodbye to her family and the naysayers... so why are the people who never cared about her before starting to take an interest in her?\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Original Novel:** [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/53601030), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=8039386)\r\n\r\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%AA%BB%EB%82%9C%EC%9D%B4-%EA%B3%B5%EB%85%80%EA%B0%80-%EB%90%98%EC%97%88%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/2448), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/56148134)\r\n\r\n**Official Translations:**\r\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/i-woke-up-as-ugly-duckling)\r\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc29306?from=manga_index)\r\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E9%86%9C%E5%85%AB%E6%80%AA%E5%8D%83%E9%87%91%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%8D%E6%93%8A/197)\r\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/i-woke-up-as-ugly-duckling-fr)\r\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.tappytoon.com/de/comics/i-woke-up-as-ugly-duckling-de)\r\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/I-Became-an-Ugly-Lady/161)\r\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/67447)\r\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81/129)",

The problem is that the man I’m supposed to marry, the legendary knight of the North, is the same man who will end up murdering me and my entire family.\n\nI have to find a way to survive.\n\nWithin the novel itself, there are many daunting challenges ahead of me: I have to find a way to save my husband’s little sister, win over my cold-hearted husband, and gain the support of the people of the North, all of whom currently despise me.\n\n“I’m in love with you!”\n\nSo please, don’t kill me!\n\n---\nI thought I'd finally escaped my hellish life when I died in an airplane crash, but I fell into another nightmare when I awoke as Rudbeckia de Borgia, a minor villain from a historical novel destined to die at the hands of her husband, Iske van Omerta. Surviving with the dysfunctional Borgia family is hard enough, but now I have to marry the man who will kill me! Still, it’s okay, I just have to convince Iske, his family, and all his countrymen that I’m completely harmless! How hard can that be?",

His high school now teaches magic, and students are encouraged to try and become accomplished magicians. A world that ran on science now runs on magic. However, some things are still the same. He still has a teacher who sees him as a hopeless student, classmates who look the same, a father who struggles to make ends meet, and a not-by-blood little sister who can't walk on her own.\nHowever, Mo Fan discovers that the vast majority of magicians can only harness one element of magic. As luck would have it, however, he is an exception—a versatile mage!\n\n(Source: WebNovel)\n\n\n---",

A second life she hadn't wanted. She had already enjoyed everything in her previous life, and had tried everything she had wanted to try. If she has to be reborn, it's just annoying and boring no matter what she does. In the meantime, Prince Caesar visits the duchy to avoid a power struggle, and Helena, who recognizes Caesar's talent, decides to become his swordsmanship teacher.\n\n\"I'll make you an Emperor.\"\n\nIt was just something I started thinking about, using the skills of my previous life to train future students and liven up my boring life. But even if you like me, don't you think you like me a bit too much?\n\n---\nDante Lenatous, who'd become the Empress Regent in her past life. Five hundred years later, she's reborn as the youngest daughter of a duchy?\n\nI have already achieved everything I wanted in my past life and done everything I'd wanted, so no matter what I do in this unwanted second round of life, it's annoying and boring.\n\nSince I was reborn anyway, I'd been thinking of teaching young students, but... my disciples love me too much. Was I this talented at teaching?\n\n\"If it's for you, Teacher, I can even lead this world to ruin!\"\n\nAll I'd done was discovered Prince Caesar's talent, so why is he acting like that?!\n\nThe teaching of young students by the Max-Level Princess who has no regrets or lingering feelings towards life--!\n\n---\nI was an illegitimate daughter abandoned by the promiscuous emperor. From there, I ended up on the street where I learned that I had a knack for the sword. I competed in tournaments, became a mercenary, and I made a name for myself.

Then one day, as Jin-Kyung was no-lifing as usual, he was summoned to ‘Another World’, and came face-to-face with a bright-eyed, hopeful Summoner… Interesting enough, in the world that Jin-Kyung was summoned to, his Social Anxiety Disorder disappeared, and he was also able to wield immense power, and became the strongest summoned being there ever was!! The story of a former girl group otaku turned powerful 2D otaku, and the story of a weak and feeble Summoner commences now!",

But the Baengri estate was a den of vipers that swallowed her whole, and it's only when she's standing at the funeral of the father she never truly understood that she realizes how familiar this story is. When she wakes up six years old again, Yeon knows she can't waste her second chance. This time, she's going to save her father. This time, she's going to live without regrets.\n\n---\nHere, inside this martial arts novel, there is a true teacher who teaches the arrogant male lead and awakens him through death. Handsome, good-natured, righteous, strong, and… Anyway, there was one big flaw in the male lead's damn fine teacher. It was his foolish only daughter who was filled with greed. A tenacious villainous extra, who always comes back to haunt the male lead in every way, but cannot be abandoned because she is his teacher's daughter. Throughout reading the novel, I cursed at that daughter. Saying that if it were me, I wouldn't live like that.\n\n'But that didn't mean that I wanted to be her!'\n\nWhat was worse, Father has already died, and my reputation was the worst. Inevitably, I ran away, but… I died. However, when I opened my eyes, Father was alive?!\n\n'If so, in this life, I will definitely save Father!'\n\nHowever…\n\n\"To think they’re aiming for my granddaughter?! I'll kill them all!\"\n\nWhy do I see Grandfather, who doesn't even appear many times throughout the novel, so often like this?\n\n\"Marriage? No. Yeonie said that she would live by my side for the rest of her life.\"\n\nEven Father, somehow became weird. Moreover:\n\n\"Why do you keep avoiding me? Is this also my mistake?\"\n\nIsn't the main character suddenly becoming obsessed with me?\n\n\"Originally, I was destined to die. Until you came here.\"\n\nI saved the time-limited bastard, but isn’t it that no good deed goes unpunished?\n\n\"At least when I'm in front of you… I don't think I’m trash.\"\n\nThe villain who blew off my neck is suddenly trying to repent.\n\nIs it really okay if it's like this?",

Then I transmigrated into the book *The Fairy's Garden*, but why did I have to possess the villainess?!\n\nAine le Peregrine, an infamous *femme fatale*, was the villainess. Besides harassing the heroine, she also has a peculiar hobby of collecting beautiful men. But in the end, she died at the hands of the men she collected…\n\nNo, I can't die like this! Alright! Starting today, my goal is to say farewell.\n\n---\nI need to safely break up with these men immediately!\n\n\"The reason I came to the duchy today is not to break off the engagement, but to tell you I have no intention of breaking off the engagement.\"\n\n…Why is this man acting like this? The Grand Duke who should be falling in love with the heroine does not want to break off our engagement. Not only him, but the unfathomable Assassin King J and the wolf-man that brings out my motherly instinct, Shion… The more I try to get rid of them, the harder they stick onto me. Will I be able to safely break up with these three men and preserve my life?!\n\n---\nAyne le Poregrin has three \"trophies\" in her collection of men: a reluctant fiancé held hostage by his debts, a fickle assassin paid to be her lover, and a soulless pet dog won at a slave auction. But to suddenly wake up one day as this femme fatale is the worst possible surprise. As the villainess of the novel *The Fairy Garden*, the new \"Ayne\" is fated to die a painful death at the hands of her very own trophies! To sidestep her grim future, she knows she'll need to break up with all three. As soon as she tries to say goodbye, however, each man becomes attached and won't leave her alone! Can Ayne turn their affections towards the story's heroine and save her own life in the process? Based on the hit novel.\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=54889995)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/i-bid-you-adieu)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/i-bid-you-adieu-fr)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://kakaopage.co.id/content/Harapan-tuk-Berpisah/3426)",

The seventh time that I was betrayed and killed, I was completely free of lingering feelings.\n\n“I’m glad that you’re a scumbag until the end.”\n\nI won’t be swayed by love anymore.

But in her eighth resurrection, she no longer bends to the nobles that encircle her, nor does she continue to live in the shadows of her wicked brother and stepsister. With a sacred power passed down from her lineage and the title of Family Head, she sets out for revenge and to change the grave destiny that awaits her.\n\n---\nSeason 1 artist: Mingsung\nSeason 2 artist: ZI.O\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%A0%91%EA%B7%BC-%EB%B6%88%EA%B0%80-%EB%A0%88%EC%9D%B4%EB%94%94/2497), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/56976992)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* English: [Radish](https://radishfiction.com/stories/17114), [Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/solitary-lady/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E8%A6%AA%E8%BF%91%E7%9A%84%E5%8D%83%E9%87%91/148)\n* [French / Français](https://fr.piccoma.com/fr/product/33)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Solitary-Lady/83)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/72845)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87/202)\n\n[Official English Novel Translation](https://radishfiction.com/stories/18632)",

And I am Melody, the villainess in said novel who was punished alongside my mother for harassing the Duke's precious little girl. I didn’t want to die like that, so I decided to treat her well. I fed Loretta, put her to sleep, and played with her. And then her response was…?\n\n\"I hope Melody marries Loretta!\"\n\nThrough her endless affection, I ended up coming back with her to the Duke's mansion, where she said \"I'll stick close to Melody!\"\n\nHas there ever been anyone who is such a 'fool for Melody?!' Why am I being loved when I've only been kind to be able to live peacefully…!\n\n---\nWhen Melody discovers she's a villainess in someone else's story, being a slave dealer's daughter only adds to her guilty conscience. After her mother kidnaps Loretta, Duke Baldwin's long-lost child, Melody tries to comfort the scared little girl and forms a sisterly bond with her. So when the duke finds them, he takes both of them home because now they're inseparable! As the rest of House Baldwin becomes enamored with Melody's warm heart, will she ever learn that she deserves to be loved too?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EC%97%AD-%EC%86%8C%EB%85%80%EB%8A%94-%EC%82%AC%EB%9E%91%EB%B0%9B%EA%B8%B0%EA%B0%80-%EB%B6%80%EB%81%84%EB%9F%AC%EC%9B%8C%EC%9A%94/3321), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/61192421)",

Her fate seems sealed until her husband Khalid, the terrifying archduke of Caltes, makes a cryptic promise to save her life. That’s when Idris wakes up a year earlier, on the day of her wedding, with a chance to redo it all. But while she’s grateful to be alive, her memories aren’t adding up. The Khalid she remembers was a ruthless tyrant, but the man before her now is affectionate and kind. Was their loveless marriage just a horrible dream or has Idris’s past become twisted in reality? She has no choice but to trust Khalid’s heart if she wants to survive and find out who tried to kill her.\n\n---\nIdris was forced by her family to marry the tyrant Grand Duke. She was not loved by her family because she was an illegitimate child, but she continues to have an uneasy marriage with Khalid, the tyrant. Then one day, Idris, who was stabbed on her vital point, let Khalid end her life, hoping that she'll still live. When she woke up, she came back in the past, precisely on her wedding day. But Khalid, who had never laughed before, said all sorts of sweet nothings and laughed saying that he'd do anything for her. Suddenly her tyrant husband… had changed!\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=55539262)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/my-husbands-reversal)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/9775)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://www.webtoons.com/zh-hant/drama/the-tyrant-husband/list?title_no=3275)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/comics/my-husbands-reversal-fr)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/62578)\n* [Spanish / Español](https://www.webtoons.com/es/drama/the-tyrant-husband/list?title_no=3541&page=1)",

Although many assassins try to poison her, they all end up failing! In fact, the poisons Giselle ingests actually taste… good?! Can Giselle leverage this ability to survive her new surroundings?\n___\nAfter waking up in the body of Giselle Rozevin, possibly the worst character from the novel, *The Poisoned Apple*, our protagonist has one goal: escape the original Giselle’s miserable fate of being poisoned to death by assassins while trapped in a prison cell. Thankfully and strangely, she finds out that poison is ineffective on her and that she can distinguish them by taste. Thus, having fallen out of favor with the good guys, Giselle uses her new unique skill to appeal to the villains. However, is joining hands with the villains really the right choice?",

He starts fighting with the determination to return to Earth. Hell was like a game. A UI pop-up window like an RPG game appears in front of your eyes as a hologram, there is a status window, and you learn skills and acquire items. Even though he almost lost his life several times from the ferocious beasts of hell, he persisted and continued to grow. \n\n10 years passed, 50 years passed, and 80 years were taken.

He himself declares that he will not fight anymore and will live normally. \n\nHowever, the hometown Earth, which should be peaceful, was in a state of air raids by beings from another alien dimension, and the 'great upheaval' began on the day Daesung fell into hell. Since then, in the earth of cataclysm, in order to counteract the monsters that have entered the earth, a monster-specialized monster extermination certificate called 'Hunter' has been created. \n\nDaesung, who promised to live a normal life without fighting, makes one decision. home just returned. To protect the barely reunited family, the enemies from that extraterrestrial dimension must be exterminated. \n\nHaving made up his mind to become a hunter, he goes back and forth to the Pantheon and unlocks the powers of hell one by one. and your own world.

At that moment, I immediately became overwhelmed with the responsibility and sense of duty a modern adult would have. \n\n**\n\nAiden had his back turned away from her and suddenly grabbed her arm forcefully.

After fifteen regressions, I was exhausted.\n\nI prayed, \"I don't want anything to do with this, so please just let me die.\"\n\nAnd at the moment when I thought could finally be able to die, someone said, \"How about being my daughter?\"\n\n…That monstrous grand duke adopted me.\n\n---\n\"I want to quit. I don't want to live being exploited again.\"\n\nDespite having the powers of a saint, she had to live her entire life in captivity—all for the sake of the fake saint who was anointed in secret. Unable to endure the torture any longer, she died alone and returned back in time. Daina, who chose a different path at the end of her forced repeated regressions, was adopted by the Grand Duke in a twist of fate…\n\n\"As the sole daughter of the Teresia family, I will make it so that you have everything.\"\n\nNow that she has a new name and understands the importance of family, Daina decides to exact revenge so she can no longer be used by the temple.\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%8C%80%EA%B3%B5%EA%B0%80%EC%97%90-%EC%9E%85%EC%96%91%EB%90%9C-%EC%84%B1%EB%85%80%EB%8B%98/3524), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/61913707)",

When I was born, Mom's wrongdoings have already been revealed leading to her confinement in the tower, and soon she'll receive a miserable death at the hands of the main characters. I held her hand while looking over my mother who searched for her ex-husband until her dying breath. My small hand entwined Mom's rough one and she finally turned to me with a warm gaze.\n\n\"I understand you, Mom.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Don't struggle anymore, and rest well.\"\n\nAnd don't wait for something like Dad who won't come. At my words, a tear fell from my mother's eye and soon, she comfortably rested. As the novel's villainess is dead, I, her daughter, will also die tomorrow night by those people. And then the second part of the novel will start. A novel where the main characters go on adventures, love and become happy at the first part. But I don't want to die and I have no thoughts of letting the second part flow as it is.\n\n\"It's fine even if I'm this mean.\"\n\nIt's a life where I don't know when I'd die anyway, so might as well change how the novel's second part goes.\n\n---\nBorn as the daughter of a villainess, Daphne lived her entire life hated by everyone she's ever crossed paths with. After her mother's pitiful death, Daphne knows that a similar fate awaits her-- but what did she ever do to deserve it? Why does she have to be branded as a wicked child when she's done no wrong? In order to survive, Daphne will have to take her life into her own hands... but will she be able to make a name for herself, or will she be known as the villainess's daughter forever?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%85%EB%85%80%EC%9D%98-%EB%94%B8%EB%A1%9C-%ED%83%9C%EC%96%B4%EB%82%AC%EB%8B%A4/3017), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/58038491)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/the-villainesss-daughter/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%AA%BD%E5%AA%BD%E6%98%AF%E6%83%A1%E5%A5%B3/271)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Born-as-the-Daughter-of-the-Wicked-Woman/47)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/93619)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2/302)",

        "description": "Nearly 2000 years ago, the prosperous Han dynasty of China collapsed. Heroes rose and fell, and three nations emerged–Wei, Shu, and Wu. Historians refer to this period as the Three Kingdoms period. The romance of the three kingdoms is an intriguing tale of heroic deeds, of alliance forged and broken, of loyalty and betrayal.  \n  \nHong Kong artist Chan Mou retells this classic tale in \"The Ravages of Time\" from the perspective of the Sima clan, which in the end united the three kingdoms. Readers will be attracted by an array of well-developed characters and Chan Mou's own unique top-notch art-style. Whether you have played Dynasty Warriors or not, this is definitely worth a read!",

While trying to figure out how to pay off their debts, she found a leaflet from the duke looking for a lost child. The reward is so much money that she could play and eat even after she payed off her debts! Following the memories of reading this book, right away, Lizelle picked up the boy who was caught in a trash dump in a poor village. She took the lost Lapel and went to the duke.\n\n\"This is the child the Duke is looking for.\"\n\nDuke Chester said, looking at me with a doubtful glaze, \"I need confirmation, so you should stay with my nephew in this house for the time being.\"\n\nThe strange cohabitation of the three people started like that. However, Lapel keeps thinking of her as a mother and won't let her leave.\n\n\"Let's get married.\"\n\nLizelle was startled by the unexpected words, \"Are you insane? Did you drink?\"\n\n\"One year. If you perform a contract marriage for one year, I will pay you ten times the amount of the rewards you were given.\"\n\n\"Can I call you 'honey'?\"\n\nAnd the contract marriage and marital life began. But why are his eyes constantly changing? Why do you keep coming every night!\n\n---\nNotorious for her extravagant spending, Wilhazelle Fossier drove her house to complete financial ruin. To pay her family's debt, she resolves to collect a bounty from the wealthy Duke Heillos by finding his missing nephew. Although her search is successful, until the skeptical duke can confirm the young boy's identity, Wilhazelle must spend one month living at the Heillos manor. But when one month turns into one year and a contract marriage, she starts to wonder if the money is worth it!\n\n---\n**Original Novel:** [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/55415041), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=8734091)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%82%A8%EC%A3%BC%EB%A5%BC-%EC%A3%BC%EC%9B%A0%EB%8D%94%EB%8B%88-%EB%82%A8%ED%8E%B8%EC%9D%B4-%EC%83%9D%EA%B2%A8%EB%B2%84%EB%A0%B8%EB%8B%A4/2769), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/58578389)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/the-rewards-of-marriage/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/15209)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%92%BF%E5%88%B0%E4%B8%80%E6%A8%81%E5%A5%91%E7%B4%84%E5%A9%9A%E5%A7%BB/351)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/The-Rewards-of-Marriage/586)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/95361)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%99/414)",

One fateful night, Hayeon, who's known him since their college club days, confesses to Doyun that she wants in on his passionless arrangement. The problem is...she has a long-time crush on him!

After living for 10 years with no love or money, he dies of incurable disease. No, I only thought that he was dead. At the same time as his death, Cassia returns to the first day she met him, 10 years ago. However, I don't want to repeat the same life as before, so I declared a \"strike.\" Cassia, who was blunt and knew nothing but war, was determined to live on her own without being discouraged. Strangely, Zester in this life continues to try to get into Cassia's heart. Cassia, who didn't hate Zester’s efforts and changes at the same time, said, “I think that maybe I can manage change it in this life.”\n\n---\nAlthough Baroness Cassia is on her deathbed, she’s relieved that it means she’s finally free from her loveless marriage to her mercenary husband, Zester. Oh, how she regrets her tireless efforts to keep his territory afloat! If only she had taken more time for herself. Her wish becomes reality when Cassia wakes up to find herself ten years back in the past. With this second chance, she’s determined to live a stress-free life. But can Cassia find the courage to rebel against Zester? Or is she doomed to repeat her nightmare of a past life?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%97%AC%EB%B3%B4-%EB%82%98-%ED%8C%8C%EC%97%85%ED%95%A0%EA%B2%8C%EC%9A%94/3024), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/57878517)\n\n**Official Translation:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/baroness-goes-on-strike/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E9%A0%98%E4%B8%BB%E5%A4%AB%E4%BA%BA%E7%BD%B7%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%AD/247)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Sayang-Aku-Akan-Berhenti-Bekerja/111)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/89552)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B0_%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B3%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99/286)",

To make matters worse, the children I care for will become my murderers and the villains of this novel. In order to survive, I attempted to escape, but these cute little rascals couldn't bear to see me leave. Since they are still young, maybe I can raise them to become good people instead of bad ones. How hard could it be to raise a few villains?\n\n---\nI became the nursery teacher of the children who would become the future Black Sorcerer, the Head of Dark Guild, and Psychopathic Emperor. I didn’t want to get entangled and wanted to sneak out of the nursery, but instead, I decided to raise the poor little villains with full sincerity.\n\n“Teacher, are you leaving us behind?”\n\n——\n\n“If you look at this handsome face a little more, you won’t be able to win.”\n\nMasha, who had taken off his dress and wore a neat uniform, grew up as a narcissistic adult.\n\n“Teacher, the more dangerous I am, the more likely you will not take your eyes off of me. I’m weak at the poor things.”\n\nAlthough he is the Empire’s number one in rough and fierce ways, Jeremy is strangely soft for Hannah, but his way of affection was a little off.\n\n“I’m going to listen to whatever you want. Whatever it is, whatever it is for. Instead, the teacher should stay with me.”\n\nIan, who became emperor, is he truly such a foolish pushover? If so, is he hiding something else?\n\nOh, come on.\n\nI think I raised them properly, but I think there’s a bit of a problem.\n\n“I have a lot of impure things I want to do with you.”\n\nHello, Pope, what’s wrong with you?",

Subjected to live the life of a siren, Aria had experienced, seen, and heard many horrific things. Others would do anything to hear her sing, to the point of insanity.

Should I get closer?\"\n\nDietrian barely swallowed a groan. His hand grasping Leticia's shoulder was shaking with a sweet faze, but she didn't notice.\n\n\"I know that you're uncomfortable. But please bear with me until my mother comes.\"\n\nDietrian hated Leticia. It was natural as Leticia's mother killed his family. She had never doubted the fact. So she didn't know, how badly his face was distorted by her words.\n\n\"You just have to put up with me for half a year. Then, I will divorce you as you wish.\"\n\nAt the word 'divorce,' he grit his teeth.\n\n---\nDespite being the daughter of the Holy Empire’s most revered divine leader, Leticia is rumored to be a ruthless, bloodthirsty tyrant. The thing is… none of the rumors are true! After years of living as her vindictive mother’s scapegoat, Leticia is ultimately cursed to die if she doesn’t kill her beloved husband, King Ditrian, with her own two hands. But when the clock miraculously resets to mere days before their wedding, she gets a second chance to save not only Ditrian, but his entire kingdom. This time, will the world recognize the real Leticia before it’s too late, or is history doomed to repeat itself?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%8B%A4%EC%A0%95%ED%95%9C-%EA%B7%B8%EB%8C%80%EB%A5%BC-%EC%A7%80%ED%82%A4%EB%8A%94-%EB%B0%A9%EB%B2%95/2485), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home/56704518)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* English: [Radish](https://radishfiction.com/stories/17978), [Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/saving-my-sweetheart/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E5%8F%AA%E6%83%B3%E5%AE%88%E8%AD%B7%E6%BA%AB%E6%9F%94%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%A0/171)\n* [French / Français](https://delitoon.com/webtoon/la-sainte-et-le-dragon)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/The-Way-to-Protect-the-Lovable-You/129)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/72384)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%89%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5/157)",

I’ll conquer the entire continent and attain my sweet revenge on Lacuz.  \n  \nAnd so, I turned to evil and wicked ways, as befitting my role as a witch.  \n  \n“You. Become my vassal.”  \n  \nI even won over the princes with my overwhelming strength. So I thought that everyone would fear me, but…  \n  \n“I picked this up for you. You can decide to eat it or throw it away.”  \n“Can’t you touch me just once? If I tell others that you stroked my head, they would be so jealous.”  \n  \n…What the hell? What’s going on with them?  \n  \nWasn’t this imperial family full of violence and murder? Shouldn’t they be trying to kill me?  \n  \n“Keep doing it more. You’re so cute.”  \n“You’re cute no matter what you do, so do whatever you want.”  \n“You’d be cute even if you killed someone…”  \n  \nThe whole lot of them must have gone insane. They’re all showing such unconditional love and affection towards me.  \n  \n“What do you think of a man 200 years younger than you?”  \nTo make things worse, the head mage of the magic tower, a complete oddball, is now clinging to me.  \n  \n…Will I be able to sit on the throne?",

        "description": "I had been working hard as the Duchess for nine years, supporting my quiet and indifferent husband, but all I was left with was contempt, indifference, and accusal of having a love affair. So when he finally asked for a divorce to marry his long-time lover... “There’s a limit to what I can endure for this marriage. No matter how much you cry or plead to the Emperor, I can’t stand it anymore.” “Can I sign here?” “So if you pretend to be poor like last time, this time… what? I waved divorce papers on an indifferent day. “I’m done. Can I go now?” “Oh, since we both had lovers, of course, I won’t be receiving alimony, but you’ll surely return my dowry, right?” “What are you gonna do with that little money?”, asked my husband, who had not cared what he had done for the past nine years. I laughed confidently and answered: “I’m going to open a dessert cafe.”",

While she had been considered very capable in her homeland, the complex and foreign customs of the Tang court are something else entirely; and although she had not expected love in a political marriage, the sheer disinterest and arrogance of her husband is very hard to handle, no matter how capable and handsome he may be.

But against all odds, he was rescued and finally stepped into the outside world. Though free, Woo-jin wasn’t like other children. He had an extraordinary gift—the ability to read people. By observing the smallest facial expressions and unconscious gestures, he could see through their thoughts, emotions, and intentions with near-perfect accuracy. Like a profiler, like a modern-day Sherlock, Woo-jin learned to navigate the world, one observation at a time. But for someone who sees too much, living an ordinary life is the hardest thing of all. All he ever wanted was a peaceful, simple life. But the world had other plans. “As I thought… living a normal life is far too difficult.”",

Apparently, I am the greatest villain in this novel!\n\nThe deaths, the chaos in the empire, and the matters of inheritance locked the duke’s children and me into a corner of the manor. But the novel never mentioned anything about being locked away. So here, I must survive and grow… for a villainous happily ever after.",

Gender roles and concepts had completely switched, from marrying off females to marrying off males, with the female side even having to pay bride dowry. Women working to put food on the table and men being househusbands had become commonplace, and the women without a car or a house are now not only looked down upon, but also hard-pressed to find themselves a man. A woman pursuing a man is not worth batting an eyelid, but the reverse can raise eyebrows...... \"Even in this world where chicks all chase after me, I insist on being a real man!\"",

Within the span of a hundred years, living creatures began to mutate and devour each other while the remaining humans, numbering in the tens of thousands, struggled bitterly in their man-made bases.\n\nIn the Abyss, home to the mutated xenogenics, there lived a sentient little mushroom. Because it had been nourished by the blood and flesh of the deceased human An Ze, not only did it take on a similar-looking human form, but a similar name as well: An Zhe.\n\nAn Zhe is determined to go to the human base to search for his spore, which had been harvested by humans. Once there, however, he faces the omnipresent risk of discovery and certain death as he tries to keep his non-human nature hidden from the Judges, whose responsibility is to inspect for and eliminate xenogenics like himself. And of all the Judges, Colonel Lu Feng is the most perceptive and merciless—as soon as he determines that someone is a xenogenic, he will execute that person on the spot.\n\nBut An Zhe’s mutation goes undetected by Lu Feng’s eyes, and so a tale of humans and xenogenics unfolds…\n______\n\n**Silver Award winner at the 12th Chinese Nebula Awards for Chinese Science Fiction**",

        "description": "A scheming, manipulative alpha pretending to be an omega × an omega pretending to be a cool-but-cowardly alpha\n\nGu Yu, who was originally a top designer at a high-end bespoke fashion boutique, happened to read an ABO novel without purchasing a subscription. Shortly after, she was inexplicably forced to transmigrate into the story. Worst of all—she became the novel's evil side character, a fake alpha who was actually an omega, left to the grim fate of being burned alive by the heroine for abusing her. As she stared at the blackened \"two-faced\" heroine Su Yue kneeling in the rain outside, Gu Yu felt completely devastated.\n\nTo save her life, Gu Yu decided to risk acting out of character and she secretly—yet while openly caring for the female lead—designed the most beautiful and unique evening gown in the world for her, clung onto her tightly, provided her with resources, and helped her dominate the entertainment industry and reclaim everything that was rightfully hers. But Gu Yu never expected that the \"innocent little princess\" she had been caring for so preciously not only turned out to be a fake omega, but an alpha! This wasn’t how the story was supposed to go! Believing her days were numbered, Gu Yu waited for her impending death in despair. However, Su Yue, exuding a strong red wine-scented pheromone—pinned Gu Yu down and whispered, “Are you prepared to be marked by me?” That familiar voice rang in Gu Yu’s ears, completely disrupting her soft heart.",

But most of all, she’s tired of Emperor Mikhail’s near-constant attention! He’s just so perfect… always concerned about her well-being and shielding her from the church’s attempts to label her some kind of saint. And he keeps finding reasons to brush her hair behind her ear or stare dreamily into her eyes. How’s a girl supposed to sleep through all this endearingly loving attention?!\n\n---\nFeeling hopeless in a cold-hearted society, I arrived in a different dimension, Altius Empire! It’s the first oracle in 32 years and there’s nothing I can do to meet the expectations of the Empire’s citizens. There’s nothing different in this world. The cold treatment is no different from the previous world. After a series of disappointments swept through, what came after was fatigue and lethargy. I don’t want to do anything. I’m not doing anything but I don’t want to do anything more intensely. Even so…\n\n“What did you do all day long today?”\n\nDid he come here to criticize my guts with biting remarks? A language bomber with 10,000 levels of shaming mental offence, Emperor Mikhail Dnar Altius. Why does he come to my room every day with a fresh look on his face? What’s this familiarity? Pardon me, but are you my mother? Ha, I’m not fond of the Emperor.\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=56193888)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/the-meaning-of-you/info)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/77525)",

        "description": "When six-year-old Inés laid eyes on the handsome heir to House Escalante, she promptly made the boy her fiancé. Since noblemen are all the same, she figured she might as well choose a pretty one. But Lord Cárcel isn't ready for this sort of commitment just yet, and he spends the next decade and a half avoiding the marriage at all costs! Luckily, that's no trouble for Inés, as this marriage failing is exactly what she wants. In fact, he has her blessing to sow his wild oats as long as he stays out of her business. Unfortunately, being a playboy isn't as fun when your fiancée gives you permission. And doesn't this mean she's cheating on him too? Now, Cárcel is determined to change Inés' mind about him and prove he can be the husband she's always wanted.\n\n---\nNote: The webtoon is released as R15, it's not R19 like the novel.\n\n[Original Novel](https://ridibooks.com/event/15574)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%9D%B4-%EA%B2%B0%ED%98%BC%EC%9D%80-%EC%96%B4%EC%B0%A8%ED%94%BC-%EB%A7%9D%ED%95%98%EA%B2%8C-%EB%90%98%EC%96%B4-%EC%9E%88%EB%8B%A4/3066), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/60493041)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/the-broken-ring)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/14879/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E9%80%99%E5%A0%B4%E5%A9%9A%E5%A7%BB%E6%B3%A8%E5%AE%9A%E5%87%8B%E9%9B%B6/391)\n* [French / Français](https://www.tappytoon.com/fr/book/the-broken-ring-fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.tappytoon.com/de/book/the-broken-ring-de)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/The-Broken-Ring-This-Marriage-Will-Fail-Anyway/626)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/114443)\n* [Portuguese / Português](https://br.comikey.com/comics/the-broken-ring-um-casamento-fadado-ao-fracasso-webtoon/430/)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A1/486)",

It’s the story where her death was decided anyway, so she ate what she wanted to eat. Her cooking has captured The General of the Conquering Army, the duke who was cursed and can’t taste foods? \"There was nothing I wanted in this small kingdom, but now I think I do.” Why are you looking at me when you say that~?!!! The story of Legion, the occupier of the kingdom who lost his sense of taste due to the curse, and Luana, the only person who could make him taste food.\n\n---\n“Are you eating in this situation?”\n\n“Of course! I’ll have to keep savoring the taste until I die. Do you want one?”\n\nShe was reincarnated in a novel as Luana, the abandoned princess. And her death was already decided. She just wanted to let people know about her cooking talent, but she was misunderstood as a witch because of her cheese jerky!\n\nThe General of the conquering army, Duke Legion, who had lost his sense of taste, took her to the Empire for her extraordinary jerkies and to break the curse that had come down from generation to generation.\n\n“It is delicious, isn’t it?”\n\n“Prepare the same for the dinner.”\n\nShe was happy to be able to cook and eat as much as delicious food as she wanted… But now, she also wanted to look after Legion.\n\n‘Eat three meals a day, and make sure to make dessert. I’m sure he will be able to gain some weight…!’\n\n–\n\nThe Duke took the jerky from the princess. On the surface, it was no different from any beef jerky. But when he took a bite of it, it felt like a new world had opened up. The jerky, made by the princess, felt more tender than the others as he gently crushed it with his teeth. The taste of condensed meat smudged his tongue as he chewed on. It was just as she said. He could feel the savory taste of the spicy meat, and at the end of the day, he wanted to have more. The desire that he had, faded for a while.\n\n“I didn’t really want anything, but now I think I do.”",

As luck would have it, the department sees the addition of a returning manager from an overseas branch, rumor has it that she's a charming and approachable beauty who goes out of her way to care for her subordinates. But she'd never expect to find that the new manager is her ex-girlfriend, with whom she has a grudge!\n\nWhen Ji Yu was young and reckless, she had her sights instantly set on a junior sister. That junior sister had long hair and smelled nice, she just stuttered a bit and was a bit timid. Ji Yu had forced that junior to kiss with her every day, without care for the other party's consent or if the feeling was mutual. Eventually, Ji Yu had forced Yue Chu Ran to date her. As graduation approached, her conscience kicked in, and she decided to give the junior a way out. With great resolve, she wrote a passionate breakup letter, cut of all methods of contact and disappeared without a trace.\n\nWho would dare believe that Ji Yu's direct superior would have been the victim of her forced affections? In response to Ji Yu's draft proposal, Yue Chu Ran replied: \"Redo it. The logic is unclear.\" Ji Yu exchanged a glance with someone else, but Yue Chu Ran remarked: \"If you're flirting during work hours, I can fire you.\" Gradually, their conversation had taken a strange turn. \"Give me a kiss and I'll write it for you.\" Yue Chu Ran's expression remained unchanged. \"Hold my hand for an hour and you have tomorrow off.\" \"Come home with me... and I'll grant any of your requests.\"",

In her past life, she thought making Leon emperor was the only way to ensure his safety. But if she had known Leon had never wanted the crown, or that laying a crown soaked with the blood of his enemies and beloved ones at his feet would mean he would take his own life before her eyes, she would’ve found another way.

The quintessential symbol of extras everywhere! Brown hair, brown eyes, plain and simple!”\n“...”\n“This man screams ‘background character,’ living a quiet life chopping wood in a mountain village with his adorable daughter. Right? ...RIGHT?”\n\nThe knight commander merely stared at me in silence.\n\nAnd then, the unthinkable happened.\n\nBehind me, my father’s worn staff began to glow with a strange, blue aura.\n\n“...Dad?”\n\nBefore I could process what was happening, his unassuming brown hair and eyes shifted. Slowly but surely, they transformed into...\n\nShimmering silver locks and piercing blue eyes—practically shouting “I’m the protagonist!”\n\n“WHAT?!”\n\nMy simple, extra life shattered into a million pieces as my dad—no, this mysterious powerhouse—gripped his weapon and snarled:\n“Give me back my daughter, you bastard.”\n\n---\nDeserting the battlefield, Enoch Rubinstein flees with his newborn daughter Lilith to a small village to raise her disguised as James Brown, a regular, doting single father. But when the order of knights returns to drag Enoch back to the capital, Lilith finds that her father was secretly one of the empire's greatest heroes. As her father's daughter, she also discovers that she holds great potential. Will Lilith be able to keep her family safe? Or will the secrets lurking ahead overpower her?",

These celestials from the Abyss required the faith of believers to maintain their power, making Earth and its great population a jackpot for them.\n\nUnfortunately, among the good celestials who handed out blessings to humans in return for their faith, there were evil celestials who preferred to use more powerful means to just take over Earth.\n\nYeonseung Choi is one of the many hunters on Earth who protect people from the threat of the dungeons and the monsters that come from the Abyss. However, he is obsessed with training and becoming stronger, to the point that a celestial has a vision of him saving Earth from a calamity involving demonic celestials swallowing up Earth whole. Thus, she makes a contract with him to have him train and become the hero from her vision.\n\nWill Yeonseung really be able to endure the arduous training in the Abyss and return to Earth to save it?\n\n---\n\n- [Original Webtoon <Webtoon kakao>](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%A7%80%EC%98%A5%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%EB%8F%8C%EC%95%84%EC%98%A8-%EC%84%B1%EC%A2%8C%EB%8B%98/2483)\n\n---\n\n- [Official English <PocketComics> Translation](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/7757/?languageCode=en)\n\n- [Official Japanese Translation](https://piccoma.com/web/product/73053)",

Though Jeongah had felt sorry for Robellia while reading the novel, she never wanted to become her. Alas, Jeongah must accept her new reality and find a way to divorce her husband. At first, she thinks this will be easy, as the emperor is always cold toward Robellia and only expresses affection to his consort in the novel. However, every act of trying to get Alexandros to agree to a divorce piques his curiosity instead. Will Jeongah succeed at getting the happy, solo life she wished for Robellia to have?\n\n---\nI possessed the Empress in the romance novel. Isn't that supposed to be good? But the problem is that this Empress is always pushed around by the deceitful Empress, treated badly by the Emperor, and she eventually died from an illness.

Go on, cry more.\"\n\nThen I was then picked up by a black panther with an awful personality.\n\n\"You're lacking in fighting spirit. I'll eat you the day after tomorrow, so keep trying.\"\n\nThis fierce beast. Staring at my trembling face, the black panther's eyes glistened.\n\n\"How thrilling.\"\n\nMom, I think he's crazy! To survive a fairly crazy black panther.\n\n\"The wild beasts are possessive, no matter what it is.\"\n\n…Is it possible?\n\n---\nVivi is a... wererabbit?! As a creature that’s supposed to transform into a human, Vivi is a failure, demonized as cursed and sent off to her doom. Luckily, her demise is cut short as Ahin of the Black Leopard Clan saves her. But with every threat and command this temperamental heir tosses at Vivi, she’s questioning her safety (and sanity). Surrounded by carnivores and their strong pheromones, she'll try to survive the chaos while stuck in her rabbit form. Will she figure out how to transform and tap into the power within her cute, furry self?",

However, when she opened her eyes once more, she returned to the past. To the past – the day of her beloved father’s, Duke Den’s funeral. From then, Chloe made a decision. A decision to not allow her past life to repeat itself... and to punish her relatives and the vassals who dared turn their backs on her family.\n\n---\n“So many things would have been different if you had become the family head…”\n\n*My older twin brother died at my hands.*\n\nChloe, who was controlled by black magic and forced to murder endlessly against her will, ultimately ends up killing her older twin brother. With barely a moment to mourn, the tip of her sword was immediately pointed at Chloe’s heart. Chloe died a miserable death. But when she opened her eyes again, she realized that she had gone back in time.\n\n*I won’t repeat my past life. In order to protect my family and my beloved older brother, I will personally become the master by becoming my brother.*\n\n“Look forward to it. You are the ones who pushed me to this point.”\n\n---\n**Original Novel:** [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/54824372), [Naver](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=8629075), [Ridibooks](https://ridibooks.com/books/2057181273)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%B9%BC%EC%95%97%EA%B8%B4-%EA%B0%80%EB%AC%B8%EC%9D%98-%EC%A3%BC%EC%9D%B8%EC%9D%B4-%EB%90%98%EB%A0%A4-%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/3182), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/60828356)",

Between foiling her abusive new father's plans of committing treason, finding a way out of her engagement to the crown prince, and avoiding the strange duke who seems to be stalking her, Jeongyun has a very long to-do list.

These gates brought on many new changes including the birth of heroes called “hunters” who could fight back the monsters that came out of the gates.\n\nHowever, because these hunters were specially chosen by transcendent beings called “sponsors,” the hunters began to call themselves “gods” and organized a new world order called “Eden.” Unfortunately, the people who were not chosen became slaves to the hunters and these self-proclaimed gods.\n\nNow, in the present, Junkyung Lee, a powerless ordinary person, is training hard so that he can get sponsored to be a hunter. However, in the middle of his training, he and his mentor, Sungkoo, suddenly get attacked by the ruler of Eden.\n\nBefore Junkyung gets killed, Sungkoo manages to send Junkyung back a hundred years into the past with the task of changing the course of history and the fabric of society!\n\n---\nNote: Raw is splitting chapters by season (last chapter is season 4, ep. 45), while tappytoon translation is not (last chapter is ep.150).",

        "description": "Princess Chervianne Aerveldote has lived a lonely life, and now she's being put to death for a crime she didn't commit. However, her execution turns out to be a fresh start when she wakes up as her 5-year-old self with an ability to read people's thoughts with status windows. Chervianne quickly learns how badly she misjudged everyone in the past, finding affection and betrayal in unexpected places. But will her newfound insight be enough to change her story and finally find love in her life?\n\n---\nI was condemned as a cruel villain and sentenced to death. But somehow, I was transported back to the past when I was a five-year-old child. The moment I faced my father, who looked much younger now, a strange blue window appeared before my eyes — it was a pale blue window that revealed another’s inner self.\n\n[Alderuan Erveldote]\nRole: Emperor (Lv.99)\nFavorability: 90,980,984\nMood: Dear daughter I miss you\n\n…But Father...? I assume it’s Dad's feelings but… What the Hell is going on?\n\n[Damian Erveldote]\nMood: Glad to see my sister\nThoughts: I want to talk to you T ^ T\n\n[Ellie]\nMood: Holding back from breaking the wall because it’s too cute\nThoughts: I’ll definitely make a commemorative collection titled “The Daily Life of a Cute Princess!”\n\n[Karmen Kasselov]\nMood: Excited\nThoughts: Why is it that every time I see you, you are one step more beautiful? What do they feed you at my palace? Do they have a magic potion that can make everyone this beautiful?\n\nI used to think that everyone held a grudge against me, but seeing how they treat me like that I guess that’s not true?! If what the status window tells me is true then maybe I can live a better life in this lifetime!\n\n---\n[Original Novel](https://page.kakao.com/content/57183975)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%83%81%ED%83%9C%EC%B0%BD-%EB%B3%B4%EB%8A%94-%EC%95%84%EA%B8%B0-%ED%99%A9%EB%85%80%EB%8B%98/3053), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/60402003)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://pdt.tencentac.com/?adtag=appshare.ios.detail%26QQ%26364&contentId=364&platform=IA)\n* [French / Français](https://fr.piccoma.com/fr/product/1184)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/The-Status-Window-to-the-Soul/638)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/128062)",

Eventually they become friends, but when Lark finds out he may have to return to the orphanage, Setz decides he does not want to lose his friend and invites him to his home… The world of the Vampires.  \n  \nNote: This project began as an amateur manhwa on Naver, but became popular enough that Naver chose to turn it into a professional work. The author and artist changed their pen names and restarted the series from the beginning, redesigning the artwork and part of the storyline in the process.",

In order to save Elisha, Rosetta swears to use everything at her disposal...including the male lead's brother. But will this villainess's plan succeed?\n___\nI’ve had enough of being transmigrated into novels.\n\nYou would be tired of it too, especially if it was already your fourth time doing it. This time, I became the female lead’s villainous older sister.\n\n‘Oh, I’m so sick of this.’\n\nYet again, I was sure this life wouldn’t be exciting either. I had led straightforward lives before, and then I died and moved on to the next.\n\nBut why was it that this iteration was a tad different?\n\n‘Why can I use the abilities I had in my second transmigration?’\n\n‘Why is the female lead bothering me so much?’\n\nAlicia, this novel’s protagonist, was fated to have a poor, emaciated life. However, considering that she was this novel’s true heroine, I couldn’t just let her roll through the mud like this. I would do everything in my power to change her fate.\n\n‘My younger sister, don’t become the female lead this time.’\n\nTo achieve my goal through a project hereby dubbed as the [Mob-Alicia Project], I’ve recruited the male lead’s older brother.\n\nCassion Carter.\n\nHe was the villain who was almost killed—no, was fated to be killed—by the male lead.\n\n“If you want to live, promise me one thing.”\n\nAs if he was a wild beast that had been hunted and left to die alone, he breathed with incredible difficulty. I reached toward the poor man’s face and caressed his cheek, leaning down to whisper softly.\n\n“If I save you…”\n\nLay down your own life on the line to protect my sister.",

She was getting along with her citizens and living a quaint, favorable life until foreign migrants kept increasing and she got involved in some odd situations?! The lively, entertaining, romance, fantasy story of a super OP ruler Rose and Yggdrasil, the grand sorcerer who wants to hide her away and protect her!\n\n---\nWhen the Kingdom of White was conquered 500 years ago, the king and his subjects were exiled to a small tract of wasteland covered in ice. There they endured cold and hunger, relying on the magic of Archmage Yggdrasil to build the world’s smallest self-governing territory. As the last heir to her family, Rose now rules over this land as its lord. Rescuing former citizens who have fallen prey to trafficking abroad, she pours her heart and soul into making them thrive at home. But first things first, she must fill up the treasury to fund this mission! The business-savvy lord invites dragons, dwarfs, and elves to join in the effort, turning White into a haven for all races. Yggdrasil couldn’t be prouder of this utopia in the making, but will Lord Rose ever get to leave her money troubles behind?\n\n---\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/patience-my-lady)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.dongmanmanhua.cn/FANTASY/qingrenrenwodelingzhudaren/list?title_no=1815)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://www.webtoons.com/zh-hant/fantasy/lord-calmdown/list?title_no=3578)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://manga.line.me/product/periodic?id=Z0001625)",

The catch? The kingdom is quite literally crumbling due to the lack of architects. Vivielle may still be a child, but she has lifetimes' worth of training as an architect stored in her brain! If she rolls up her sleeves and gets to work, can she lay a strong foundation for her future and build back up hope in the kingdom?\n\n---\nIn her third life, she was reborn as the only daughter of a villain that didn’t have blood nor tears. People lived in a house that was on the verge of collapsing, so she designed a building using her previous life’s knowledge. However, her dad caught her and—\n\n\"We passed a bill that the building's ownership would be given to the person who organized the building's construction.\"\n\nShe became the owner of a large building.\n\n'Let's just get some slush funds and retire!'\n\n\"The lady kept me from getting hungry!\"\n\n\"I can sleep in a warm, new house thanks to milady!\"\n\n\"The youth employment rate rose sharply!\"\n\nWhat did I do? Is it such a big deal that everyone had to praise me this much? To make things worse, my father found out about my plan to flee from home…\n\n\"What did I do wrong? I'll fix everything, so don't leave.\"\n\n\"T-that's not it…\"\n\n\"I'll give you anything you want. Oh, right, didn’t the emperor’s son bother you? I can also cut the emperor's neck, what do you think?\"\n\nThen, like a bolt from the blue, he thought of starting a war.\n\n'Why do I keep getting more work?'\n\n…C-can I retire safely?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%95%84%EA%B8%B0-%EA%B1%B4%EB%AC%BC%EC%A3%BC%EB%8A%94-%EC%9D%B4%EB%A7%8C-%EC%9D%80%ED%87%B4%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/2904), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/58712950)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/the-little-landlady/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://pdt.tencentac.com?contentId=260&platform=AA&adtag=appshare.android.detail%2526%25E5%2585%25B6%25E4%25BB%2596%2526260)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E5%A4%A9%E6%89%8D%E5%BB%BA%E7%AF%89%E5%B8%AB%E7%B6%AD%E7%B6%AD%E7%88%BE/310)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Bayi-Pemilik-Gedung-Pensiun/116)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/102505)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%88%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%97/354)",

        "description": "After his death, Shen Yuan found himself in the world of a Xianxia (supernatural martial arts) novel that he likened to trash shortly before he died. As per the genre, one would expect him to reincarnate as the protagonist, right?  \n  \nWrong. Instead, he transmigrated into the body of Shen Qingqiu, the titular \"scum villain\" who, in the novel's canon, eventually gets killed by the actual protagonist Luo Binghe for being a sadist teacher. Determined to avoid the same fate, Shen Yuan uses his knowledge of the novel's plot and tropes to endear himself to the characters (especially to the protagonist), to ensure that he keeps his life.  \n  \nUnfortunately for him, he's accompanied by a video game-like \"System\" that monitors and grades his actions, keeping him from taking too many liberties with how his character acts and how the story progresses. And if he ignores its warnings, the consequences will be deadly. Thus his foray into the world of cultivation begins…  \n  \nNote: \"Scumbag System\" is the official English title. This is based on the novel The Scum Villain’s Self-Saving System.  \n  \n[Animated adaptation link](https://wetv.vip/play?cid=m2c25jodoyslvyv&vid=b0034kbtr75&languageid=1491988&3_3.1.0.5739_copy)",

This situation... How did this happen...?' In order to avoid the future where she dies a horrible death, Elisha decides to become the possession of a maniac. She offered up her body as guarantee and became a contracted fiancée of his. Where will this contract lead to...?!\n\n---\nOrphaned and living in a monastery, Elisha de Lauer was content and happy. That was until the De Cartiers, known for having magical abilities, came to find her. This snake-filled family forces Elisha into a slave contract with their eyes on inheriting her many assets. After years of servitude to the De Cartiers, Elisha meets a gruesome end at the hands of her captors. That would’ve been the end of her tale, but as she closed her eyes to die, she awoke again in her own past as if nothing had ever happened. With this second chance, she vows revenge on the De Cartiers and finds the perfect accomplice in rumored maniac, Lucerne des Kayas. Lucerne, an outcast member of the De Cartier family, has also sworn revenge on them. But, his unwavering distrust of everyone stirs him to form a contract with Elisha only under one condition. She must agree to marry him. Flung into a fake marriage, these two align to uncover the secrets of the De Cartiers and bring each member down. There’s just one secret they each can’t seem to figure out.

But when Selena’s family and a knight prevent her from dying, what can she do…?\n\n---\nMy sick sibling has passed away, so I don't want to live anymore. With that, I chose to end my life, but how did I become a villainess in a novel?! Facing with such a miserable end, I thought I could end this troubled life with my own hands… But why are they still trying to save me?\n\n\"Don't deprive me of your partner status, Selina.\"\n\n\"Can you dare to be greedy?\"\n\nMy life is getting better and better, but the death day is also getting nearer. What do I have to do?\n\n---\n[Original Novel](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.nhn?productNo=6327781)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Comico](https://www.comico.kr/comic/7404), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=59942846)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/7404?languageCode=en)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/7404?languageCode=zh)\n* [French / Français](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/7404?languageCode=fr)\n* [German / Deutsch](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/7404?languageCode=de)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://www.comico.jp/comic/7404)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://www.comico.in.th/titles/3030)",

And although I was clearly one of the female protagonists, I possessed the body of Evenes Harin, the saint who is treated like a trivial extra. What’s worse is that I must pursue one of the five male love interests and see it through to a happy ending in order to complete the game.   \n  \nHaving attended the triple combo of an all-girls middle school, high school, and university wasn’t enough of a debuff, having unintentionally put up an iron defense, I’ve been in ‘forever alone’ mode for 25 years. On top of that, I’ve possessed the Saint seldom played due to her atrociously difficult route! This life is screwed up, and I’m sure of it.  \n  \n“The more you look at it, the more novel this situation is.”  \n “…?”  \n“How would you feel about living here like this?”  \n  \nBoasting a 99.9999% probability of a bad ending: the obviously crazy Archmage.  \n  \n“Evenes Harin.”  \n“?”  \n“Now I’m sure you serve the devil. Or are you really crazy?”  \n  \nThe epitome of rudeness: the seriously narcissistic Crown Prince.   \n  \n“I’ve made up my mind.”  \n“Shut up.”  \n“I’ll make you into my first doll.”  \n  \nInstead of wrinkles on his brain, it’s full of blooming flowers: the yandere Merchant Union’s director.  \n  \n“…”  \n“… Do you have something to say?”  \n“*(shakes head)*”  \n  \nAt the level of a shadowy human, a man of few words: the underworld guild leader.  \n  \nAt the lowest level, the most ordinary one is the empire’s youngest swordmaster: the knight commander…  \n  \n“Lady Saint.”  \n“Yes.”  \n“When I’m together with my Lady, my heart feels at ease.”  \n“… Ah.”  \n “I feel like I am one with Lunium.”  \n  \nAs you can see, he is a zealous follower of the Temple of Lunium.  \n  \n“Would you not like to visit our house?”  \n “… Your house?”   \n“There is something that I would like to show you. Only to you.”  \n  \nAnd even the duke’s daughter, who can be called the true heroine, is acting like this.  \n  \n… Will I really be able to complete this game without any problems?  \n\n\n---\n\n[Novel Illustrator's Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryoyell)",

The Imperial family then lost their power and was caught in the flames of rebellion, and I was the first to be abandoned. Alone, cold and hungry, I lived on the streets until a kind couple took me in and I became Ethel, a commoner. Stella the princess was no more.\n\nNow, after 10 years, I have to return to the Imperial palace where I was abandoned, because my \"family\" wanted to see me.\n\n“I need a replacement,” my sister, the first princess, told me, “You'll replace my missing sister.”\n\nOf course, they don't even recognize that I am the real missing sister, since they never looked at me anyway.\n\n“That’s a tempting offer, but I don’t want it, princess.”\n\n“Are you sure you want to turn down my offer?”\n\nHer threat is so clear, but I might as well have my revenge and return the palace to play the role of my own substitute. I will humiliate these people who don’t recognize me, I will never forgive them. They'll try to win the heart of their princess who has awakened her powers, but this time I'll be the one to abandon them.\n\n“In the end, I’ll be happy.”\n\nThe splendid return of the abandoned princess.\n\n---\nWith the entire Belvice Empire awaiting her abilities, Princess Stella’s life is turned upside down when she fails to bring the stars into the sky. Discarded by her family as the empire is overthrown, she is taken in and raised by commoners. But when the empire is restored and her conceited sister finds her, Stella’s peaceful life is threatened once again. Is she doomed to live as a puppet for the family that hated her? Or can she shatter their demands and rise as the true leader of Belvice?",

To hell with the original story! I have to try and survive first. Thus, I was just trying to flee to the neighboring country, but then…\n\n“I’ve waited for 100 years just to meet you.”\n\nThe man who had hidden his identity as the Demon King and was the driving force behind the invasion. Grand Duke Arvis grabbed me with a gaze filled with intense emotions.\n\n“If I lose you… I’d probably start by wiping out this continent that took you away from me.”\n\n…Just why?\n\n---\nIt's just Ara's luck to be hit by a car and reborn in a novel as the villainous \"Meliara.\" To make things worse, she knows that the empire in this novel is about to get destroyed by the world's Demon King in a few months, so she must make a quick escape to the far corners of the empire while she can. She just can't catch a break! But as she's leaving, she runs into the dashing and mysterious Rehett, who, for some reason, immediately offers to accompany her on her journey as her bodyguard. What's stranger is that Rehett seems to know an awful lot about Meliara's tastes and preferences from her past life, despite meeting her for the first time. How could this be? Though she doesn't know it yet, Meliara's past and current lives are inextricably intertwined for a higher purpose beyond her imagination.\n\n---\n**Original Novel:** [Naver Novel](https://novel.naver.com/webnovel/list?novelId=933815), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=5692463)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/comic/detail.series?productNo=8917860), [Naver Webtoon](https://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list?titleId=800828)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/book/i-became-the-villainess-in-a-disastrous-novel)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://manga.line.me/product/periodic?id=Z0002765)",

What she does not expect, however, is for the male leads of the novel to also end up in the same house! Will all of them be able to work together to survive in this chaos?\n\n---\nI reincarnated as the heiress of a powerful conglomerate family in a novel.

Damn it!  \n\n=\nOn top of that, somehow, the male leads ended up trapped in my house with me. And these guys don’t seem to have any intention of leaving. Why do they look like they have no plans to go to the female lead?\n\n“Who exactly are you?”\n\n“You seem like someone who knew the world was going to end beforehand.”\n\nThey were full of questions about me, but I couldn’t answer them. They wouldn’t believe me anyway. Right now, all I see them as is a good source of labor.\n\n“Alright, let’s work. You need to earn your keep for what you eat!”\n\nIf I can find the cure for the virus causing the apocalypse, this hellish time will finally end. So, until then, I’ll make use of the male leads and hang on!\n\n=\nBut one problem has come up. It turns out that this old mansion I purchased is far more suspicious than I thought.

There’s only one thing I can think of now.\n\n“I’m going to die.”\n\nI wasn’t expecting what he pulled out of his coat.\n\n“Will you marry me?”\n\n“What?”\n\n---\nI witnessed the novel's villain murdering someone - and even got caught witnessing it! I can practically hear the bell signalling the end of my life ringing. However, what he gave me was... \"Marry me.\" A ring. One with a huge gem at that! What's going on here?! Is this not better than dying, My Lady? Let's get married. My newly-wed life with the villainous lead begins now!\n\n---\nWhisked away into the novel *The Forbidden Fruit of Isotta* and the body of Regina Blois, our female protagonist has the advantage of knowing how her story unfolds - which is that she is to be murdered by Duke Arsene Graroy! Her death moves the story forward and sets up her good friend and protagonist Isotta in a love triangle with the Emperor and the Duke when she tries to uncover the truth behind Regina’s death. Not wanting to be murdered this time around, our new Regina keeps a low profile. She still manages to catch the eye of the Duke, but when he confronts her this time, it seems he's less interested in murdering her and more interested in... marrying her?",

Her older brother became the emperor, so what was she supposed to do? And due to the laws of inheritance, even if her older brother and younger brother were to die, she would still not inherit the throne - rather, her good-for-nothing cheater of a husband would!! Any title she inherits would be vested in her husband in accordance to their marriage contract... that is, until he decides to divorce her because his mistress wants to be the official queen.\n\n“I need to get divorced and become the emperor.”\n\nHer now official ex-husband still doesn't seem to get it, so she decided to finally tell him everything she always wanted to say to his face. When he realized the truth, it was already too late. She spoke to her ex-husband who had his mouth agape.\n\n“I told you to keep your head straight. Didn’t you hear me?”\n\n---\nRevenge is sweet. Divorce? Even sweeter.\n\nArnoa is trapped in a loveless marriage in which she has sacrificed both her heart and dignity. In the midst of such matrimonial misery, she receives the chance to claim the Empire as her own. There's just one catch: she needs a divorce to make it happen! Will she succeed in getting the last laugh?",

        "description": "I was described as the short-lived childhood friend who turned the male lead into a tyrant in the novel. I died on his behalf, as the novel said. I thought I could now return to my original world. …But why am I back to the age of ten? Is there something wrong with the original story? I can’t help it! I thought I would succeed this time and go back to reality… This tyrant dream is too realistic to be true!\n\n“I don’t care about the throne.”\n\n“What?”\n\nWhat is it? Did I say this before my regression?\n\n“What are you talking about? Becoming emperor…”\n\nYou should meet the heroine and the original story should go on. That way I can go back!\n\n“Viche,” Jade was calling me somewhere with a low voice, “I can’t let you go… for whatever reason.”\n\nThere was a soft smile behind Jade’s bleak eyes. …I think he knows something.\n\n---\nA young Korean woman is reincarnated inside a novel as Viche Amelian, who according to the story, is to be executed in place of the young prince Jade for assassinating the emperor. After facing her death, she expects to get her old life back, but instead wakes up as a ten-year-old Viche! Could it be that her death failed to turn Jade into a tyrant, as the story foretold? Viche must now figure out where she went wrong, and make sure that this time, Jade becomes the world’s most wicked tyrant!\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=57021973)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/my-bff-is-a-tyrant-in-training/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%88%91%E6%8A%8A%E9%9D%92%E6%A2%85%E7%AB%B9%E9%A6%AC%E5%9F%B9%E9%A4%8A%E6%88%90%E6%9A%B4%E5%90%9B/240?tab=episode)\n* [French / Français](https://fr.piccoma.com/fr/product/224)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/I-Turned-My-Childhood-Friend-Into-a-Tyrant/157)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/75078)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%AB%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A/269)",

Being a tyrant? If you’ve lived your life to the fullest, that could happen. But there can be no problems at night.”\n\nRiggs was so frustrated that it seemed like he was going crazy.\n\nA few days later, the reclusive Duke of Cardiago came to the temple.\n\nOf course, the most surprising thing to Isabelle was the true identity of her childhood friend.\n\n“Isabelle, you wanted to get married. You can’t say no because you proposed first. I’m the closest man to your ideal type anyway.”\n\n“My ideal type?”\n\n“Don’t I know your ideal type? You like guys who are tall, handsome, smell of soap at night, and sleep in simple clothes. Also, on the first night, the bed should break.”\n\n“…”\n\n“That’s everything, and I can do it all for you. So marry me.”\n\nShe once knew everything about her childhood friend, but that changed the moment they got married.\n\n“Riggs, slow down…”\n\n“I think I’m slow enough.”\n\n“You weren’t always this impatient.”\n\nIsabelle said pleadingly, but Riggs replied with a smirk.\n\n“I was a childhood friend then, but now I’m your husband.”\n\n---\nIsabelle has always dreamed of meeting her true love and living happily ever after. Unfortunately, she discovers that she was just sold to the monstrous Duke Cardiego, who's infamous for killing his bride candidates. Her only way out is to quickly marry someone else, and as it turns out, her BFF, Lix, is the perfect choice! Although she tells him she will just stay a friend, Lix begins to show her that he doesn't feel the same way. Will their friendship be able to last through this matrimony?",

Even from his friend Sion, he hides the fact that he is a witch and lives alone a little far from the village. Then one day, her fairy appears in front of her and she calls herself her dragon lord. \n\n\"Yes? Fairy Ariel? Maybe the protagonist of that fantasy fairy tale? It's unfair that the place of reincarnation is in a fantasy fairy tale I read by chance, but I have to become a hero to defeat the demon king! How can a witch do that?\" \n\nAnd Bris finds out the truth about another witch... Is the villain in this fairy tale really the villain?\n\n---\nAfter a life full of hardship and heartache, Chon-Eun Ha died in the hospital all alone. However, she woke up suddenly in a lush forest, reincarnated as a witch an a wonderous fantasy world full of magicians, knights and other creatures. A world so wonderous, in fact, that suddenly she finds a fairy has moved into her house. \"My brave warrior! I've been waiting for you! I'm sorry I must have startled you!\" What is this fairy doing in my house?! \"My name is Ariel!\" No way, ***the*** heavenly Ariel from the *Tale of Ariel*?!\n\n---\nEun-Ha Cheon was just an ordinary teenage girl until she woke up one day and discovered that she was not Eun-Ha Cheon anymore, but a witch named Blythe in a magical world. Fearful of prejudice and desirous of a quiet life, she hides the fact that she’s a witch, but this becomes tricky with the arrival of a beautiful fairy who won’t stop calling her a warrior. She doesn’t want to be a warrior or anyone’s hero. All she wants is an ordinary life… But as she learns more about her identity and her world, will she ultimately get what she wants?\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/content/57268828)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/accidental-warrior/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc31059)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/83761)",

I mean, he’s the perfect man, so who wouldn’t want to marry him? As Schueur, I was supposed to be the villainess, but I’d rather save my honey! His Highness’s special ability consumes his emotions every time he uses it, so my goal is to awaken feelings in him. So far, I’ve only caused him irritation and annoyance, but one day I’ll make him notice me!\n\n---\nIn this novel, my favorite character died. After being rejected by the female lead and losing his emotions, he could no longer use his abilities, and as he became weak, the North collapsed. Even his body was never to be found, but the novel only depicted the happy ending of the protagonists.\n\nAnd I possessed the body of the villainess \"Schuer\" from that novel.\n\n\"Rather, I'll make him regain his emotions before he meets the female lead.\"\n\nThus, I left for the North.\n\n\"Grand Duke, can you hold my hand just once? Or maybe a signature. I'll keep it as a heirloom.\"\n\n\"If you want my signature, you too should sign and stamp here, my Lady.\"\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\n\"A marriage certificate.\"\n\nHuh?\n\n\"You can just act you usually do. It seems like your behavior is somewhat getting on my nerves.\"\n\n...Did I win the jackpot?",

Having worked so hard in her previous life only to die young, Alice wants to live this new life in peace. There’s only one problem: her mother-in-law is trying to frame her for the murder of her husband. Using her knowledge of the novel, can Alice subvert the original plot into something that might allow her to live in peace, or is she doomed to live as the caretaker of a comatose husband until her death?\n___\n\"The deadline is six months, within which you must kill your husband.\"\n\nOn the first night of their marriage, I possessed the body of 'Alice,' a villainous supporting character who was ordered by her mother-in-law to kill her husband.\n\nI thought I was married off to a duke who's a living  corpse for the sake of money, but lo and behold, this duke has a great body and is handsome as well. Instead of killing him, I looked for a way to survive by using divine power instead of poison.\n\n\"Mother, I will become a priestess for the duke!\nAs a priestess, I shall pray for the duke's well-being for the rest of my life!\"\n\nOn the day I was about to leave the duke's mansion, my husband who had been unconscious suddenly woke up.\n\n\"You're the one who brought me out of the darkness, so take responsibility.\"\n\nHe wakes up and demands I take responsibility after saving him?",

Diarin promises divorce when she finds the prince that was engaged since he was a child, in exchange for him staying in her territory for one year. However…  \n  \n…  \n  \nDiarin leaned towards Yejet as best as she could, to try and look as natural as possible.  \n\"I will annul the engagement for you.\"  \n\"Huh?\" Yejet asked again, after blankly saying \"Huh?\" in the moment along with the driver.  \n  \nYejet's gaze was very peculiar. It was only thanks to Diarin putting in all of her focus on Yejet, that allowed her to just barely notice that odd gaze. Yejet didn't take his eyes off of Diarin's once.  \nHe asked her, \"Are you talking about Duke Concul?\"  \nIt was a sentence spoken as quietly as Diarin's. Excluding the driver, no one could hear their conversation.  \n  \n\"No way. Do you think the duke would actually let go of Your Highness? If he could, he would probably tie you up with a rope as tight as he could.\"  \n\"Then?\"  \n  \nDiarin in the quietest voice, as though ice might shatter if she spoke too loudly, \"I'm talking about you.\"",

He kills criminals with black magic making him a dark hero (think of him as Dexter or batman with dark magic). She (MC) doesn't have any death flags since she’s a background extra but she was a homeless girl of all things in such a dangerous novel. Somehow our MC saves the male lead and to thank her, he adopts her.\n\n“Become my daughter.”\n\nThe richest, most powerful, and handsome duke asks her to be his child. The MC is freaked out since she knows he’s a cold blooded killer. Can she survive such a maniac? Yet he dotes on her and constantly says ‘my daughter is the cutest’! He wants to get master artists to draw her and gather poets to describe her adorableness. The duke also has a son. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree; he also dotes on her. In this way, a beggar became a little princess. She also got used to people getting killed.\n\nHowever there was still one problem. Our MC has turned sixteen and is wondering as a lady, will she have an arranged marriage? The whole house atmosphere quickly turns awkward. She realizes, perhaps they want her to stay here forever?
