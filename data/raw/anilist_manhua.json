And that's not all: the mangy dog he had picked up by chance is now the leader of a sect, the little girl he had adopted out of kindness has become a fairy of a heavenly realm, and his disciple, whom he had been forced to take in, has become the Celestial Emperor.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Bilibili Comics)",

His new fate leads him to save the life of the country's top assassin “King of Hell”. To repay him, Ah Dai is taken away by the assassin to receive intensive training. What will become of Ah Dai?\nAh Dai is a very kind and soft-hearted kid. His favourite thing is steamed bun and his favourite girl is Ya Tou. But steamed buns are always in shortage and Ya Tou left him, never coming back. \"What is wrong and what is right\", even someone as silly as Ah Dai sometimes asks this question, especially when he was forced by a gangster to pickpocket others on the street. One day, he got a money bag full of amethyst coins from a passerby, and the coins started to talk and shine with mysterious light. \"Do you want to go with me?\" That rather strange handsome passerby asked him. \"Can I have steamed buns everyday.\" \"Yes, you can.\" And our Ah Dai joined this mysterious magician to start his fantasy cultivation journey...and eat steamed buns everyday...\n<br><br>\n(Source: Mangatoon)\n",

She diligently cultivated her way to immortality, and she was about to ascend and return to her own world when a mysterious glitch caused her to transmigrate again, this time into a world of magic (like the start of an otome game). She met the main heroine, who was being bullied by the villainess at the Magic Academy, and that was when Jiang Yang realized that this is the world of the game she was working on? Now her fate is tied to Xin Lu, the heroine of the game. Jiang Yang thought that if she just beat the game, she can finally return home. But as the story progressed, she remembered all the over-the-top plotlines made up by the lousy writers, and she can't stand seeing Xin Lu suffer through it anymore. So she steps in and helps Xin Lu reject the playboy prince, teaches her cultivation techniques to fight off the bullies, and even seduces Xin Lu herself! As they become more intimate with each other, Jiang Yang starts to realize that her fate might intertwine with Xin Lu more than she realized…\n<BR><BR>\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)<br><br>\n<i>Note: Includes one extra chapter.</i>",

Thus humans entered the continent without any form of equipment. While some explorers have discovered incredible riches, others were stranded on the continent.

The affairs of state are more important.\" But Qi Nian finally relented as rumors that \"the emperor is impotent\" began to spread.\n<BR><BR>\nYu Dingdang is a rather dim-witted girl, but born to a prestigious family. This led many to say: \"Miss Yu exchanged her brain for her looks\". Nobody expected that she would be chosen by the emperor to be his empress consort? Yu Dingdang acted surprised on the outside, \"Who? What? Me?\" But inside she was thrilled, because she has wanted to become Qi Nian's bride ever since she was little. When she successfully marries her crush, that is when a slapstick comedy breaks out in the palace, when she finds out that the haughty emperor is actually a woman?!\n<BR><BR>\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)",
