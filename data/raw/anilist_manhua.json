As the last remnants of humanity huddle in their bases, the remaining lifeforms have mutated into so-called xenogens and taken over the outside world.<br><br>\n\nIn the midst of this war for life or death, a sentient mushroom lived his little life in the forest. That is, until humans came and took something precious from him — his spore. With his life's purpose gone, the young xenogen is ready to risk his life to reclaim it. So, donning a dead boy's face and calling himself An Zhe, the little mushroom makes an attempt to infiltrate a human base.<br><br>\n\nTo get inside, he must first get past the Supreme Judge Lu Feng, whose job it is to detect and kill any mutants who try to sneak through the gate. It is said that nothing can escape his cold sight, which is now locked on An Zhe...\n<br><br>(Source: Aloha Comics)<br><br>\n<i>Note: Silver Award winner at the 12th Chinese Nebula Awards for Chinese Science Fiction.</i>",

And that's not all: the mangy dog he had picked up by chance is now the leader of a sect, the little girl he had adopted out of kindness has become a fairy of a heavenly realm, and his disciple, whom he had been forced to take in, has become the Celestial Emperor.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Bilibili Comics)",

His new fate leads him to save the life of the country's top assassin “King of Hell”. To repay him, Ah Dai is taken away by the assassin to receive intensive training. What will become of Ah Dai?\nAh Dai is a very kind and soft-hearted kid. His favourite thing is steamed bun and his favourite girl is Ya Tou. But steamed buns are always in shortage and Ya Tou left him, never coming back. \"What is wrong and what is right\", even someone as silly as Ah Dai sometimes asks this question, especially when he was forced by a gangster to pickpocket others on the street. One day, he got a money bag full of amethyst coins from a passerby, and the coins started to talk and shine with mysterious light. \"Do you want to go with me?\" That rather strange handsome passerby asked him. \"Can I have steamed buns everyday.\" \"Yes, you can.\" And our Ah Dai joined this mysterious magician to start his fantasy cultivation journey...and eat steamed buns everyday...\n<br><br>\n(Source: Mangatoon)\n",

She diligently cultivated her way to immortality, and she was about to ascend and return to her own world when a mysterious glitch caused her to transmigrate again, this time into a world of magic (like the start of an otome game). She met the main heroine, who was being bullied by the villainess at the Magic Academy, and that was when Jiang Yang realized that this is the world of the game she was working on? Now her fate is tied to Xin Lu, the heroine of the game. Jiang Yang thought that if she just beat the game, she can finally return home. But as the story progressed, she remembered all the over-the-top plotlines made up by the lousy writers, and she can't stand seeing Xin Lu suffer through it anymore. So she steps in and helps Xin Lu reject the playboy prince, teaches her cultivation techniques to fight off the bullies, and even seduces Xin Lu herself! As they become more intimate with each other, Jiang Yang starts to realize that her fate might intertwine with Xin Lu more than she realized…\n<BR><BR>\n(Source: Bilibili, translated)<br><br>\n<i>Note: Includes one extra chapter.</i>",

Thus humans entered the continent without any form of equipment. While some explorers have discovered incredible riches, others were stranded on the continent.
