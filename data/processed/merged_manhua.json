The thread of fate connected her to Stardew, the heroine of the game who is being bullied during her first year at the Royal Academy of Magic.\n\nAs the game progresses, Jiang Yang remembers the ridiculous story the game follows, and she decides that she can’t stand by while the game makes Stardew suffer. She helps Stardew deal with the flirtatious love interest of the original game, Crown Prince Miller, and even imparts her with some of her cultivation power. To protect Stardew from the game’s story, she even puts herself in danger. However, as Jiang Yang and Stardew’s relationship becomes closer, Jiang Yang realizes that the thread of fate connecting her and Stardew is not as simple as she imagined.",

Historians refer to this period as the Three Kingdoms period. The romance of the three kingdoms is an intriguing tale of heroic deeds, of alliance forged and broken, of loyalty and betrayal.  \n  \nHong Kong artist Chan Mou retells this classic tale in \"The Ravages of Time\" from the perspective of the Sima clan, which in the end united the three kingdoms. Readers will be attracted by an array of well-developed characters and Chan Mou's own unique top-notch art-style. Whether you have played Dynasty Warriors or not, this is definitely worth a read!",

Gender roles and concepts had completely switched, from marrying off females to marrying off males, with the female side even having to pay bride dowry. Women working to put food on the table and men being househusbands had become commonplace, and the women without a car or a house are now not only looked down upon, but also hard-pressed to find themselves a man. A woman pursuing a man is not worth batting an eyelid, but the reverse can raise eyebrows...... \"Even in this world where chicks all chase after me, I insist on being a real man!\"",

Within the span of a hundred years, living creatures began to mutate and devour each other while the remaining humans, numbering in the tens of thousands, struggled bitterly in their man-made bases.\n\nIn the Abyss, home to the mutated xenogenics, there lived a sentient little mushroom. Because it had been nourished by the blood and flesh of the deceased human An Ze, not only did it take on a similar-looking human form, but a similar name as well: An Zhe.\n\nAn Zhe is determined to go to the human base to search for his spore, which had been harvested by humans. Once there, however, he faces the omnipresent risk of discovery and certain death as he tries to keep his non-human nature hidden from the Judges, whose responsibility is to inspect for and eliminate xenogenics like himself. And of all the Judges, Colonel Lu Feng is the most perceptive and merciless—as soon as he determines that someone is a xenogenic, he will execute that person on the spot.\n\nBut An Zhe’s mutation goes undetected by Lu Feng’s eyes, and so a tale of humans and xenogenics unfolds…\n______\n\n**Silver Award winner at the 12th Chinese Nebula Awards for Chinese Science Fiction**",

Shortly after, she was inexplicably forced to transmigrate into the story. Worst of all—she became the novel's evil side character, a fake alpha who was actually an omega, left to the grim fate of being burned alive by the heroine for abusing her. As she stared at the blackened \"two-faced\" heroine Su Yue kneeling in the rain outside, Gu Yu felt completely devastated.\n\nTo save her life, Gu Yu decided to risk acting out of character and she secretly—yet while openly caring for the female lead—designed the most beautiful and unique evening gown in the world for her, clung onto her tightly, provided her with resources, and helped her dominate the entertainment industry and reclaim everything that was rightfully hers. But Gu Yu never expected that the \"innocent little princess\" she had been caring for so preciously not only turned out to be a fake omega, but an alpha! This wasn’t how the story was supposed to go! Believing her days were numbered, Gu Yu waited for her impending death in despair. However, Su Yue, exuding a strong red wine-scented pheromone—pinned Gu Yu down and whispered, “Are you prepared to be marked by me?” That familiar voice rang in Gu Yu’s ears, completely disrupting her soft heart.",

However, who knew that after ascending, achieving immortality and becoming a Martial God that thousands of people worshipped, that his life would only go downhill. He was demoted and fell down the ranks until he reached rock bottom.   \n  \nEight hundred years later, Xie Lian has ascended once again, but this time he has neither the followers nor any incense burned in his name. One day, on his way back from collecting trash, he picks up a mysterious youth and takes him home. This particular youth however, actually turns out to be Hua Cheng, the infamous Ghost King known throughout the three realms who could change both his gender and appearance at the flip of a dime.  \n  \nNOTE: Heaven Official's Blessing has been re-released on bilibili from the prologue with some special extras due to the original release not being very coherent unless you've read its source material (novel). This is the original version which was taken down.",

        "description": "Yue Chu Ran x Ji Yu\n\nJi Yu is a soft-spoken worker, the type to get scolded by the boss on the daily. As luck would have it, the department sees the addition of a returning manager from an overseas branch, rumor has it that she's a charming and approachable beauty who goes out of her way to care for her subordinates. But she'd never expect to find that the new manager is her ex-girlfriend, with whom she has a grudge!\n\nWhen Ji Yu was young and reckless, she had her sights instantly set on a junior sister. That junior sister had long hair and smelled nice, she just stuttered a bit and was a bit timid. Ji Yu had forced that junior to kiss with her every day, without care for the other party's consent or if the feeling was mutual. Eventually, Ji Yu had forced Yue Chu Ran to date her. As graduation approached, her conscience kicked in, and she decided to give the junior a way out. With great resolve, she wrote a passionate breakup letter, cut of all methods of contact and disappeared without a trace.\n\nWho would dare believe that Ji Yu's direct superior would have been the victim of her forced affections? In response to Ji Yu's draft proposal, Yue Chu Ran replied: \"Redo it. The logic is unclear.\" Ji Yu exchanged a glance with someone else, but Yue Chu Ran remarked: \"If you're flirting during work hours, I can fire you.\" Gradually, their conversation had taken a strange turn. \"Give me a kiss and I'll write it for you.\" Yue Chu Ran's expression remained unchanged. \"Hold my hand for an hour and you have tomorrow off.\" \"Come home with me... and I'll grant any of your requests.\"",

As per the genre, one would expect him to reincarnate as the protagonist, right?  \n  \nWrong. Instead, he transmigrated into the body of Shen Qingqiu, the titular \"scum villain\" who, in the novel's canon, eventually gets killed by the actual protagonist Luo Binghe for being a sadist teacher. Determined to avoid the same fate, Shen Yuan uses his knowledge of the novel's plot and tropes to endear himself to the characters (especially to the protagonist), to ensure that he keeps his life.  \n  \nUnfortunately for him, he's accompanied by a video game-like \"System\" that monitors and grades his actions, keeping him from taking too many liberties with how his character acts and how the story progresses. And if he ignores its warnings, the consequences will be deadly. Thus his foray into the world of cultivation begins…  \n  \nNote: \"Scumbag System\" is the official English title. This is based on the novel The Scum Villain’s Self-Saving System.  \n  \n[Animated adaptation link](https://wetv.vip/play?cid=m2c25jodoyslvyv&vid=b0034kbtr75&languageid=1491988&3_3.1.0.5739_copy)",

At the end of the cave, something suddenly begins to turn, and Ye Bingyao loses consciousness with the sound of her friend's yell in her ear. Upon awakening, she finds herself in an unfamiliar place. She realizes that she has crossed through time…and that she's naked! What's more, there's a handsome, expressionless man standing before her, holding her at gunpoint.

They saw three shooting stars pass by at the same time and made their own wishes. When they woke up the next day, they found that their souls had been swapped and began a wonderful journey. In the process, the things that they usually ignored, the things they couldn't see clearly because of their own identities, what they wanted but couldn’t get, and the compromises they had to make... Were all solved miraculously. The two were attracted to each other and eventually they ran towards each other; turning into partners who worked and grew together hand in hand. When the night where three shooting stars pass by comes again, will they be able to return to being themselves?",

I fell prey to a conspiracy which led me to be reborn in this XuanTian Continent which belongs to the lower realm. I just want to cultivate peacefully and pass the tribulation as soon as possible in order to return to the upper realm. Ye Feng, can you stop being a big spender like this? I absolutely don’t want to grow the Sect at all. You are sent by the heavens to torture me, right?”\n\nFeed the long-lost 9th Grade Breaking Tribulation Pill to the dogs, Use the painting containing forms of ruthless sword arts to light the fire. Use the supreme martial arts scroll as toilet paper. Every big shot in various sects went crazy. \n\n“Sect Leader, Ye Feng is too much of a big spender. I request you to do something about him!” \n\nRare spiritual herbs, valuable spirit mines, supreme martial arts and unlimited spirit stones. \n\n“Every treasure you dream of obtaining… I have it all! Whether to give them to you or not, it all depends on my mood. I’m just a big spender for fun.” \n\nSeeing Luo QianXue successfully pass through the tribulation… Ye Feng thought to himself: \n\n“Big spender points have been used by the system and you’ve been directly promoted to the Nine Level Of Transcending Tribulation Realm.”",

Though the intentions of the old guard at the royal court are not exactly the same, all are waiting to see how the new emperor will resolve this situation.  \n   \nUnexpectedly, before this incident comes to a head, the King of Xi Nan, Duan Bai Yue, had already personally commanded troops to battle a few thousand miles away. Not half a year has passed when peace has already been restored.  \n  \nWith sparse moonlight shining into the royal palace, Chu Yuan stamped a wax seal on a secret letter, and had it sent urgently to Yun Nan 800 miles away – this time, what will we be asked for in exchange?  \n  \nBrush marks can be seen on the back of the paper, almost as if it can be seen how angry the young emperor is when he wrote this line.  \n Duan Bai Yue spread out a piece of paper slowly, and replied deliberately with one word.  \n   \nYou.  \n  \n[synopsis taken from translator's site: <https://pucari.dreamwidth.org/>]",

In a few days, gold and silver piled up like a mountain. After the Dashing King retreated from the capital, he sent his trusted subordinates to hide the treasure somewhere beyond the Great Wall, intending to use it as a military fund to make his comeback.  \n  \nIn the 45th year of Emperor Qianlong's reign (1780), three groups of people started fighting over a treasure box somewhere in Changbai Mountains. The box content did not merely revealed the location of the Dashing King's treasure hoard. It also revealed the past related to the Dashing King's four personal guards as well as the plots and grievances of several generations.  \n  \nNote: The Dashing King (Li Zicheng) was the Chinese rebel leader who overthrew the Ming dynasty of China in 1644. He was later forced to abandon the capital city as the Manchu Banner Armies invaded. The Dashing King himself appeared in later chapters of Jin Yong's The Deer & The Cauldron (鹿鼎记).",

We see only the surface, and not what’s underneath.* What would you do if there existed a person who was blessed with the memories of their past life and continued to love you deeply in this life? He, Zhou Shen Chen, was granted such an opportunity. She, Shi Yi, who carries the burdens of their memories by herself in the present, has only ever wished for one thing in her lifetime: to find a story that truly belonged only to them in both the past and present. For richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, no matter what’s on the surface, I will always return to you. **  \n  \n*TL Note: “皮相” and “骨” is used in this sentence, which literally translates to “skin” and “bones”. Another meaning for the “骨” character can be in reference to your character/personality. Thus, the sentence is referring to the fact that the world is a shallow place, as you are only judged by your outer exterior (your skin), as most do not bother to delve further to see your inner self (your bones).  \n  \n**TL Note 2: The final sentence is a very waxing poem that she will forever follow him no matter what the destination is and whether he’s wealthy/prosperous or dirt poor which is akin to something we would find in a wedding vow.",

Is God giving me a great responsibility or is this redemption of my fate?Neither! He’s just another typical little brat of a fodder with the title of a rich playboy… My instincts tell me that I should be doing something! If not, I’ll never survive past episode three!Even though I say that he’s a typical fodder, why does this little brat have such good luck with women? Maids, rich daughters, lolis, mature ladies, even… Cross-dressers. Gosh, why wasn’t my past life this fulfilling? The world is a big place, but I’ve only been nesting inside a cyber cafe my entire past life… In this life, I’ll go around this prosperous world (with the ladies)! I’ll survive even if I’m just some typical fodder!",

In this world, survival depends on defeating monsters and leveling up, with everyone having a basic status panel for guidance. However, Shen Jin Feng quickly discovered that his panel was different. At first, he could only summon mirror images of enemies, but soon he realized he could even preclaim battle rewards — obtaining enemy mirror images, equipment, and experience before winning the fight.\n\nAlthough the number of mirror images he could summon was limited, each one represented the pinnacle of its class. Moreover, Shen Jin Feng could directly log into these mirror images and personally control them in battle.\n\nIn this world, some humans who arrived earlier had formed powerful hegemonies. They monopolized territories, bullied new arrivals, and hoarded resources — even requiring their permission just to fight monsters. To overthrow these tyrants, Shen Jin Feng, alongside his summoned mirror images, engaged in fierce battles against them.",

Some research revealed that the boss’s type was someone who was 1) good-natured and 2) good at studying. Those who scored less than 700 points weren’t even worth mentioning. Tao Zhi wasn’t good-natured either, so she started practicing 5 exams/3 years*, turning herself into a ruthless test-answering machine that woke up early and stayed up late to study for 2 weeks, and scored 350 points.\n\nTao Zhi: Look, I like you so much, how about you let this one go and let me take the test again?\n\nHow to conquer a Bking**--from 300 to 700 points--in what world does a lady as beautiful as a flower who comes from a rich family like me get looked down on, isn’t it because you’re a coward king?\n\n*referring to a workbook that simulates 5 college exams and 3 years of school\n**internet slang for someone who acts cool/like a king",

While filling her world with whispers of love, the romantic, dissolute prince turned a blind eye to the misdeeds of several other concubines, which includes framing her for adultery, disfiguring her, as well as imposing an extreme penalty against her. When she opens her eyes again, instead of travelling through time, she is reborn as a drop-dead gorgeous lady. In possession of vast wealth and surrounded by all sorts of good-looking men, she decides that she will no longer keep her nose clean. As for that liar, Prince Xuan, should still put on a show of love and affection in front of her?\n\n---\nWhen she woke up, she realized that she had transmigrated into the bed of Prince Xuan and mysteriously become his bedside maid. The prince, who's an unloyal playboy, tells her that he loves her everyday, but at the same time he allows her to be mistreated. He even watches as she is accused of cheating on him and is disfigured before being drowned to death. When she awakes once more, she is back in the present with a pretty face. Having been reborn, she no longer cares for being mediocre. With delicious food and drinks in one hand, and dozens of dollar bills on her other hand, she is surrounded by beautiful men as she lives a lavish and excessive life. That is until the lying man shows up one day claiming to still be in love with her. Is he lying, or is he being honest for once?\n\n---\n  **Original Web Comic:** [BiliBili](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc24426?utm_source=mgd&utm_medium=uploader)\n**Official English Translations:** [WebComicsApp](https://www.webcomicsapp.com/comic/5db6daba8c252b6ddd13a602), [Flying Lines](https://www.flying-lines.com/comic/rebirth-the-turnabout-of-a-mistreated-concubine)",

Before the old matriarch passed away, they handed their position over along with some good tidings: “Grand elder Cang Yue is a planted agent sent by the dynasty to monitor the sect.” “The second elder is the saintess of the celestial sea holy land. She’s been lying low inside the sect as a planted agent since she was young, and is ready to act on the celestial sea holy land’s behalf at any time.” “The magnificent master enforcer is a demon spy who’s already spilled innumerable sect secrets.” “The sect number one is a beast-eared lass: a saboteur stationed in the sect by the beastkin. She’s watched the patriarch position menacingly, preparing to seize it to promote the beast agenda.” “Even my bodyguard is granddaughter to the bandit god. She follows the bandit god’s orders by pilfering sect treasures. How sly!” In short… everyone in the sect besides me is a planted agent.",
