Readers will be attracted by an array of well-developed characters and Chan Mou's own unique top-notch art-style. Whether you have played Dynasty Warriors or not, this is definitely worth a read!",

He kept refusing the requests by his officials to choose a consort, brushing them off by saying \"the affairs of state are important, and I am busy with my work\". But Qi Nian finally relented as rumors that \"the emperor is impotent\" spread ever more widely.\n\nYu Dingdang was a particularly dim-witted girl, but born to a prestigious family. This led many to say: \"Madame Yu exchanged her brain for her looks\". Who could have expected that Yu would be selected by the emperor to be his empress consort?\n\nA happy and dramatic girl-girl romantic comedy set in the imperial palace. Yu couldn't have expected that this lofty emperor up on high was actually a girl?!",

        "description": "During her childhood years, Sienna, the vivacious Princess of the Western Empire, and Latio, the Prince of the Northern Kingdom who was sent over as a political hostage, had a fateful encounter. The two gradually opened their hearts to each other, while the young King Nyah of the Eastern Empire observed them from the shadows…   \n  \nAlas, the tranquil peace between the three kingdoms was but a mere facade, soon to be shattered at the drop of a hat. As war broke out, the past childhood sweethearts are now faced with impossible choices that pit love against duty: battle and bloodshed, smoke and tears, sincerity and betrayal— riddled with turmoil, the two must come together to compose a song, a song of a boy and girl — the “Song of Theodor”.\n\n---\n\nOfficial Translations:\n[Korean](https://page.kakao.com/content/56296842/)\n[Japanese](https://www.comico.jp/comic/231/)\n[English](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/231)",

Gender roles and concepts had completely switched, from marrying off females to marrying off males, with the female side even having to pay bride dowry. Women working to put food on the table and men being househusbands had become commonplace, and the women without a car or a house are now not only looked down upon, but also hard-pressed to find themselves a man. A woman pursuing a man is not worth batting an eyelid, but the reverse can raise eyebrows...... \"Even in this world where chicks all chase after me, I insist on being a real man!\"",

Within the span of a hundred years, living creatures began to mutate and devour each other while the remaining humans, numbering in the tens of thousands, struggled bitterly in their man-made bases.\n\nIn the Abyss, home to the mutated xenogenics, there lived a sentient little mushroom. Because it had been nourished by the blood and flesh of the deceased human An Ze, not only did it take on a similar-looking human form, but a similar name as well: An Zhe.\n\nAn Zhe is determined to go to the human base to search for his spore, which had been harvested by humans. Once there, however, he faces the omnipresent risk of discovery and certain death as he tries to keep his non-human nature hidden from the Judges, whose responsibility is to inspect for and eliminate xenogenics like himself. And of all the Judges, Colonel Lu Feng is the most perceptive and merciless—as soon as he determines that someone is a xenogenic, he will execute that person on the spot.\n\nBut An Zhe’s mutation goes undetected by Lu Feng’s eyes, and so a tale of humans and xenogenics unfolds…\n______\n\n**Silver Award winner at the 12th Chinese Nebula Awards for Chinese Science Fiction**",

Shortly after, she was inexplicably forced to transmigrate into the story. Worst of all—she became the novel's evil side character, a fake alpha who was actually an omega, left to the grim fate of being burned alive by the heroine for abusing her. As she stared at the blackened \"two-faced\" heroine Su Yue kneeling in the rain outside, Gu Yu felt completely devastated.\n\nTo save her life, Gu Yu decided to risk acting out of character and she secretly—yet while openly caring for the female lead—designed the most beautiful and unique evening gown in the world for her, clung onto her tightly, provided her with resources, and helped her dominate the entertainment industry and reclaim everything that was rightfully hers. But Gu Yu never expected that the \"innocent little princess\" she had been caring for so preciously not only turned out to be a fake omega, but an alpha! This wasn’t how the story was supposed to go! Believing her days were numbered, Gu Yu waited for her impending death in despair. However, Su Yue, exuding a strong red wine-scented pheromone—pinned Gu Yu down and whispered, “Are you prepared to be marked by me?” That familiar voice rang in Gu Yu’s ears, completely disrupting her soft heart.",

However, who knew that after ascending, achieving immortality and becoming a Martial God that thousands of people worshipped, that his life would only go downhill. He was demoted and fell down the ranks until he reached rock bottom.   \n  \nEight hundred years later, Xie Lian has ascended once again, but this time he has neither the followers nor any incense burned in his name. One day, on his way back from collecting trash, he picks up a mysterious youth and takes him home. This particular youth however, actually turns out to be Hua Cheng, the infamous Ghost King known throughout the three realms who could change both his gender and appearance at the flip of a dime.  \n  \nNOTE: Heaven Official's Blessing has been re-released on bilibili from the prologue with some special extras due to the original release not being very coherent unless you've read its source material (novel). This is the original version which was taken down.",

As luck would have it, the department sees the addition of a returning manager from an overseas branch, rumor has it that she's a charming and approachable beauty who goes out of her way to care for her subordinates. But she'd never expect to find that the new manager is her ex-girlfriend, with whom she has a grudge!\n\nWhen Ji Yu was young and reckless, she had her sights instantly set on a junior sister. That junior sister had long hair and smelled nice, she just stuttered a bit and was a bit timid. Ji Yu had forced that junior to kiss with her every day, without care for the other party's consent or if the feeling was mutual. Eventually, Ji Yu had forced Yue Chu Ran to date her. As graduation approached, her conscience kicked in, and she decided to give the junior a way out. With great resolve, she wrote a passionate breakup letter, cut of all methods of contact and disappeared without a trace.\n\nWho would dare believe that Ji Yu's direct superior would have been the victim of her forced affections? In response to Ji Yu's draft proposal, Yue Chu Ran replied: \"Redo it. The logic is unclear.\" Ji Yu exchanged a glance with someone else, but Yue Chu Ran remarked: \"If you're flirting during work hours, I can fire you.\" Gradually, their conversation had taken a strange turn. \"Give me a kiss and I'll write it for you.\" Yue Chu Ran's expression remained unchanged. \"Hold my hand for an hour and you have tomorrow off.\" \"Come home with me... and I'll grant any of your requests.\"",

        "description": "Hao Ren (literally means “good man”), as his Chinese name suggested, is a good man, and his ideal was to live a restful, comfortable life as a landlord. At least that was his plan before a couple of abnormal creatures rented his house.  \n  \nA remote, outdated big apartment, a bunch of rather abnormal non-human creatures, and a labor contract from the “god”, the three factors combined lead him to be the busiest landlord and most supernatural “babysitter”. The story of the most complicated, erratic and abnormal landlord and tenants started from here.  \n  \n“Ever since I put my fingerprint on the labor contract, I knew I was roped into something terrible…”  \n  \nAs a person who is down-to-earth as well as a good Samaritan, Hao Ren desires to live the rest of his life as a benevolent landlord. Stumbling into a curious yet mysterious lady, he began his journey of “collecting” abnormal and supernatural tenants.  \n  \nHis life only became more chaotic when he receives a labor contract from “God”. Discover the many races, myths and worlds that lie beyond what humans define as normal! This bizarre fantasy full of fun is sure to bring you on a crazy rollercoaster of emotions!\n\n- [Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%82%E5%B8%B8%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E8%A7%81%E9%97%BB%E5%BD%95)",
